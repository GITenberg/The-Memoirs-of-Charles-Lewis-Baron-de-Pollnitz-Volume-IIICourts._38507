<h2><span style="font-size: small;">THE</span><br />

PREFACE,<br />

<span style="font-size: small;">By the <span class="smcap">Translator</span>.</span></h2>

<p><i>The <span class="f">Baron de Pollnitz's</span> Account
of his <span class="f">Travels</span>, and of the Observations
he made wherever he came,
both of <span class="f">Persons</span> and <span class="f">Things</span>, has
had such a Run in Foreign Parts, that the
Bookseller at <span class="f">Amsterdam</span>, who first printed it
in three Volumes in <span class="f">12<sup>mo</sup></span>, soon after published
a second Edition of it in <span class="f">four</span> Volumes, and
has now printed a third Edition in <span class="f">five</span> Volumes.</i></p>

<p><i>The three first Volumes, which are those
that are translated in our first and second,
he calls <span class="f">Letters</span>; and to the fourth and fifth
he has given the Title of <span class="f">Memoirs</span>, which is
<span class="f">that</span> we have chose for our Translation of the
Whole.</i></p>

<p><i>It happens that these two New Volumes
were written by our Author before the first</i><!--004.png--><span class="pagenum">iv</span>
<i>and second that were translated and publish'd
last Year; but why they were not also printed
before the others, is thus accounted for by M.
<span class="f">Changuion</span> the Bookseller at <span class="f">Amsterdam</span>, in
his Preface to the Original of these Memoirs</i>,
viz.</p>

<p><i>'The Author, when at <span class="f">Paris</span>, sold the Copy
to a Person, who sold it again to a Bookseller
in <span class="f">Holland</span>; and the latter was actually
going to print it when he heard that I
was just ready to publish the <span class="f">Letters</span> of the
Baron <span class="f">de Pollnitz</span>, (the same that are the
Subject of our two first Volumes). The Title-Pages
of the one and the other had such
a Resemblance, that the Bookseller in <span class="f">Holland</span>, who purchas'd the Copy, of which
these two additional Volumes are a Translation
imagin'd it to be the same with the
other, and laid the <span class="f">MS.</span> by. But not long
after this, he took it into his head to review
it, and by comparing it with the former
Volumes, he found this a quite different
Treatise. He saw, that it not only
contain'd a History of the Author's <span class="f">Life</span> and
<span class="f">Family</span>, but an Account of several Courts
and Courtiers of <span class="f">Europe</span>, very circumstantial,
and altogether new; and that here
was a Relation of several Travels of our
Author, that to <span class="f">Spain</span> in particular, of
which there's not a Word in the former Volumes;
in short, that this Copy of his was
the Account of the Baron's <span class="f">first Travels</span>, antecedent
to those already publish'd.'</i><!--005.png--><span class="pagenum">v</span></p>

<p><i>Upon his communicating this Discovery to
M. <span class="f">Changuion</span>, the latter bargain'd with
him for it, and has just published it in <span class="f">Holland</span>, as a Sequel to the former Volumes, tho'
if he had had the <span class="f">MS.</span> sooner, he would undoubtedly
have given it the Preference.</i></p>

<p><i>At the End of the last Volume there is a
Translation of a remarkable Piece from the
<span class="f">Italian</span> Original, which is the <span class="f">Confession of Faith</span> made by the Baron <span class="f">de Pollnitz</span>, and
his Motives for changing his Religion.</i></p>

<p><i>The said Bookseller thinks, that the Author
(tho' he has since abjur'd the <span class="f">Romish</span> for
the <span class="f">Protestant</span> Religion, as may be seen in our
Preface to the first Volume) will not be angry
with him for publishing that Piece, because
it has such a tendency to confute the malicious
Insinuations which he complains of in
his <span class="f">Memoirs</span>, and proves, that if he did
not then embrace the <span class="f">True Religion</span>, he
took the Pains however to examine it.</i></p>

<p><i>On the other hand, the Publication of this
ample <span class="f">Confession</span> will demonstrate to all
Catholics, that whatsoever Arguments they
employ against Christians of the <span class="f">Protestant Communions</span>, the latter are not afraid to
let them see the Light.</i></p>

<p><i>To conclude; tho' some Places are here and
there mention'd in these Volumes, which are
also to be found in the Two First, and with
that Conformity indeed betwixt them, which
the <span class="f">Truth</span> unavoidably demanded; yet 'tis</i><!--006.png--><span class="pagenum">vi</span>
<i>proper to observe, that the Descriptions are
sometimes more copious, the Reflections almost
every where different; and that in both
there is an agreeable Variety and Vivacity
which we flatter our selves will not
fail to recommend <span class="f">These</span> to the same good Acceptance
from the Public, with which it has
favor'd the <span class="f">former</span> Volumes.</i><!--007.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>

<span style="font-size: small;">OF THE</span><br />

<div class="center" style="font-size: large;">To Madame de &mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p>The Family I am descended from was
originally of <i>Thuringia</i>. My Grandfather,
after having turn'd Protestant,
came and settled in the Electorate of
<i>Brandenburg</i>, where he was kindly receiv'd, and
advanc'd to the chief Employments by the Elector
<i>Frederic-William</i>, who made him Master
of the Horse, Minister of State, Chamberlain,
Major-General, Colonel of his Guards, and Commandant
at <i>Berlin</i>. His Brother who came along
with him had also a share of his Favor; for he
was made Colonel of a Regiment of Horse, Lieutenant-General,
and Governor of <i>Lipstadt</i>. They
both married, but the only one that left Male
Issue was my Grandfather, who by <i>Eleonora</i> of
<i>Nassau</i>, Daughter to Prince <i>Maurice</i> of <i>Orange</i>,
had two Sons, and two Daughters. This however<!--008.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
prov'd a very unsuitable Match; for my Grandmother
was imperious, frugal, and jealous, whereas
her Husband was extravagant, and an Admirer
of the Fair Sex: which Tempers so opposite to
each other created a Misunderstanding between
them, that amounted almost to a staunch Hatred.
Yet my Grandfather, some time before he died,
settled all his Estate upon her, repented of the
Vexation he had given her, and he thought this
Generosity of his would have made her easy, but
it only render'd her the more impatient to be a
Widow, insomuch that she had not the Complaisance
to conceal it from him; and the very
last Words he liv'd to hear her pronounce, were
neither comforting nor Christian.</p>

<p>Soon after the Death of my Grandfather my
Uncle died, who was my Father's own Brother.
The only Issue he left was a Daughter, who was
chief Maid of Honour to the Queen <i>Sophia Charlotte</i>,
whose Bounties to her render'd her a Person
of no small Note in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>My Father married the Daughter of Baron
<i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i> by whom he had my Brother in 1690.
I was born thirteen Months after him, <i>viz.</i> the
25th of <i>February</i> 1692, at <i>Issouin</i>, a Village in
the Electorate of <i>Cologn</i>, where my Father then
lay with his Regiment in Winter-Quarters. The
Electoress was my God-mother, and I was
christen'd <i>Charles-Lewis</i>. Before I was full two
years of Age I had the misfortune to lose my
Father, who died at <i>Maestricht</i>, and left my Mother
a Widow with three Children, and a very
little Estate to maintain us. My Grandmother,
who, as I had said before, had all my Grandfather's
Estate, was so extremely penurious, that
she had not the heart to part with any of it to
my Mother, whose Situation would have been<!--009.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
very melancholy had it not been for the Generosity
of the King (at that time only Elector).
This Prince sent for her back to <i>Berlin</i>, and gave
her a Pension; and in a little time after, my Relations
help'd her to another Husband, <i>viz. M. de
M&mdash;&mdash;</i> Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who
tho' he died at the end of ten Months left her so
warm a Widow, that me might very well pass
for one of the best Fortunes at Court; and then
she threw up her Pension, rather than keep it to
the prejudice of other Persons that stood more in
need of it, which she thought was an Abuse of
the Elector's Bounty.</p>

<p>My Mother's Fondness for me would not suffer
her to part with me, so that I was brought up
under her Wing, and at a Court which was at that
time the most splendid in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<div style="padding-bottom: 1em;">&nbsp;</div>

<p><i>Frederic-William</i>, when he died, left five Princes,
<i>viz.</i> the Elector, whom he had by <i>Louisa-Henrietta</i>
of <i>Nassau</i> Princess of <i>Orange</i>; and the
Margraves <i>Charles</i>, <i>Philip</i>, <i>Albert</i>, and <i>Christian</i>,
by <i>Dorothy</i> Princess of <i>Holstein</i>, Dowager of
the Duke of <i>Zell</i>. These Princes, at an Age
more proper for Pleasure than Business, studied
how to be most agreeable. Being frank and
generous they adorn'd the Court, even more by
their personal Qualities than by their Magnificence;
and the Elector himself contributed to
the splendor of it, by giving frequent Feasts, tho'
he was reproach'd with being too much addicted
to them, too scrupulous in the Ceremonies he requir'd
to be observ'd at them, and more expensive
in them than elegant. Nevertheless, this is what
strikes Foreigners more than any thing; and 'tis
Entertainments of this kind that give a Court
its fullest Lustre. The true Ornament of ours was<!--010.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the Electoress, Daughter of <i>Ernest Augustus</i>, Elector
of <i>Hanover</i>, and Sister to <i>George</i> I. King
of <i>England</i>. Our Elector, after burying his first
Wife the Princess of <i>Hesse</i>, marry'd his second
on the 28th of <i>September</i> 1684, when he was
only the Electoral Prince. The latter Princess,
from what Lineage soever Heaven had sent
her, had Qualities that would have procur'd her
respect: Her Beauty was regular, and tho' she
was but little in stature, her Air was majestic.
She spoke all the Languages of <i>Europe</i> that are
in present use, with ease, and was so good as
to converse with all Foreigners in their own
Tongue. She understood History, Natural
Philosophy, and Divinity; but with Knowledge
so extensive, she was extremely careful to avoid
the reputation of being Learned. As fond as she
was of Reading, she was not an enemy to Pleasures.
She lov'd Music, Dancing, and Plays;
and by her command, Comedies were often represented,
in which sometimes she did not disdain
to be an Actress. Her regard for all who
excell'd in any Art drew them to her Court, in
which Politeness bore sway, as much as in any
other Court of <i>Europe</i>. Of all things in the
world she had nothing near so much at heart as
the Education of her Son the Electoral Prince,
whom she lov'd tenderly, and omitted nothing
to inspire him with all the Ideas that might hereafter
render him as exalted in Sentiments as he
was to be in Power: And the young Prince on
his part seem'd to make a suitable return for the
Princess's care of him.</p>

<p>While the Court was thus addicted to Pleasures
and Feastings, they gave themselves little or
no trouble about the Affairs of Government; so
that <i>Dankelman</i> the Prime Minister bore the<!--011.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
weight of all. He had then the Elector's intire
Confidence, and so absolute an ascendant over
his mind, that he was suppos'd to be perfectly secure
against the disgraces to which Favorites are
commonly expos'd. The Favor he stood in,
was owing to the most important Service that
'tis possible for a Subject to render to his Sovereign:
For one day when this Prince (as yet
only the Prince Electoral) was drinking Coffee
with his Mother-in-law the Electoress, he was
taken so ill on a sudden that he was oblig'd to retire
to his Apartment, where he was seiz'd with
Convulsions which threaten'd his Life. It happen'd
that <i>Dankelman</i> then the Secretary of his
Dispatches was the only Person at hand, to relieve
him: He open'd a Box in which there were certain
Antidotes, and having given him several
Doses, for want of a Surgeon and a Lancet he
open'd a Vein with a Penknife; and his management
was attended with such good success, that
the Prince, after having had a hearty Vomit,
found himself quite out of danger.</p>

<p>An Event of this nature could not but make a
great Noise: The Vulgar especially, who are fond
of nothing so much as what is extraordinary,
thought that the Prince's Indisposition did not
proceed from a natural Cause, but imagin'd that
the Electoress's tenderness for the Margraves her
Sons was reason good enough to suspect that she
wanted to get rid of the Prince her Son-in-law,
which was to be sure the shortest way to let them
into the Succession. The Electoral Prince's retreat
to the Court of the Landgrave of <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>
seemed to give a Sanction also to a Suspicion
of that sort. But be this as it will, the Prince
stay'd there several years, during which he married
the Landgrave's Sister, by whom he had<!--012.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
only one Daughter, who marry'd in 1700, to
the Hereditary Prince of <i>Hesse</i>, now King of
<i>Sweden</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dankelman</i> was artful enough to make his advantage
of this happy Incident of having sav'd
his Master's Life: He stuck closer to him than
ever; and that grateful Prince, as soon he came
to the Electoral Dignity, made him his prime
Minister, and confer'd all the marks of Friendship
on him, that 'tis possible for any Subject to
aspire to; insomuch that <i>Dankelman</i> giving the
Elector to understand one day, that he fear'd his
Favour would be of no long duration, this
Prince was so good-natur'd, or so weak, as to
fortify him as far as was in the power of the most
solemn Oaths<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. <i>Dankelman</i> was so credulous as
to trust to those Protestations; and forgetting that
the most solid Friendship of Princes cannot be
proof against their Inconstancy or Caprice, he
thought himself above the reach of Fate, and behav'd
like a Man that had nothing to fear. But
the little care he took to gain People's Love, and
the ever-odious Titles of Minister and Favourite,
made him soon hated by the whole Court. The
Elector himself began by degrees to be out of
conceit with him; for their Tempers were incompatible;
the Minister being Covetous, and the
Prince a Man of Pomp and Expence; and he
was so perpetually teaz'd with the Remonstrances
of <i>Dankelman</i>, that he hated him in his heart long
before he durst make it appear. The Minister
too much elated with his Favour, and not so
careful to please his Master as to censure his Actions,<!--013.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
thought himself able to preserve the same
ascendant over him, or at least, did not think the
Elector would ever offer to ruin him; which
Confidence of his hinder'd him from parrying the
Thrusts that were made at him in secret; so that
he was arrested at midnight in his own House,
and carry'd to <i>Spandaw</i> in one of the Elector's
Coaches, under a Guard of twenty Men.</p>

<p>His being so suddenly disgrac'd was matter of
surprize to every body, but of concern to few.
'Twas observ'd that on the very day wherein
<i>Dankelman</i> was arrested, the Elector spoke to
him so kindly in presence of the whole Court,
that those of the nicest penetration little thought
his Fall to be so near. Indeed, every body had
long before endeavour'd, or wish'd for an opportunity
to trip up his heels; and the natural Inconstancy
of the Elector to his Favorites, and
this Minister's want of complaisance to the Elector,
made it very probable that he would quickly
be tumbled from that Summit of Favor, on
which he thought himself so sure of keeping his
Hold; there wanted only a more specious pretext
to remove a Man from Court, who had all
along seem'd to aim at nothing but the welfare
of the Government; and such a one naturally
presented itself in the affair of the Duchy of
<i>Limbourg</i>.</p>

<p>This Duchy had been mortgag'd by <i>Spain</i>, as
Security for considerable Sums which were owing
by that Crown to the Elector, who in consequence
put his Troops to quarter there for the Winter.
The <i>Dutch</i>, to whom <i>Spain</i> was a Debtor in like
manner, would gladly also have had that Duchy
made over to them, as Security for their Debt;
which not being to be done without the evacuation
of our Troops, the matter was propos'd to<!--014.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<i>Dankelman</i>, who, whether he was surpriz'd, or
brib'd, gave his consent to it. This was imputed
to him as a Crime of State the more heinous,
because <i>Spain</i> being at that time ready to conclude
a Peace with <i>France</i>, in pursuance of the Treaty
of <i>Ryswic</i>, was very indifferent as to complying
with the Demands of the Elector. To this the
Minister fell a Sacrifice, but by good luck for
him he had remitted several Sums to Foreign
Countries, so that his disgrace was the lighter;
which moreover had this singularity in it, that
neither of his three Brothers nor any of his Creatures
had a share in it, but were all continued in
their Employments; and all the alteration that
happen'd, was, that the Count <i>de Barfous</i>, then a
Veldt-Marshal, performed for some time the
Functions of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>In the mean time another Idol of Fortune rose
upon the ruin of <i>Dankelman</i>. This was <i>John
Casimir de Kolbe</i>, a Gentleman originally of the
Palatinate: His first appearance at Court was in
the time of <i>Frederic-William</i> the Great, in the
retinue of the Princess-Palatine <i>de Simmeren</i>,
Sister of the first Electoress, who having desir'd
the Elector to give <i>Kolbe</i> some Employment;
he made him a Privy-Counsellor, but gave him
liberty to attend the Princess as much as ever,
who was so good to him that she was reproach'd
with caring for no body else. He went with her
into the Palatinate, where that Princess died soon
after, and then <i>Kolbe</i> return'd to Court, where he
was a meer Stranger, without Relations, Acquaintance
or Protection; and 'twas a long time before
any the least notice was taken of him. But after
the death of <i>Frederic-William</i>, he made his Court
to <i>Frederic</i> his Son who succeeded him, and to
<i>Dankelman</i> his Minister. Being always humble,<!--015.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and a Flatterer into the bargain, he quickly
gain'd their Friendship by his Assiduity, and by
his study'd Affectation not to meddle or make
in any Affairs. <i>Dankelman</i>, as crafty a Man
as he was, did not perceive the Snare, but contributed
most of all to his Favor, thinking all the
while that he was promoting a Creature from
whom he had nothing to fear. But <i>Kolbe</i> no
sooner perceiv'd the Elector's Coldness to his Minister
than he resolv'd to make his Advantage
of it. He did not alter his Measures immediately,
but seeming to have as little Concern in
Affairs as ever, his only Aim was to feed and propagate
the ill Humors which the Elector was
often in with his Favorite. This Prince was
inconstant, suspicious and choleric; and when
those three Passions were stirr'd up and managed,
he was to be persuaded to any thing. <i>Kolbe</i>
who for a long time had made his Temper his
only Study, plainly perceiv'd his Foible, artfully
wrought upon it, and in the sequel made it subservient
to the Accomplishment of his Designs.
He soon attain'd to the highest Degree of Favor;
the Elector made him his Great Chamberlain
and First Minister; all the Court was oblig'd
to truckle to him; and as it always happens
in the Changes of Government, the Minister
in Disgrace was regretted. Indeed <i>Kolbe</i> did
not want for personal Qualities enough to make
him belov'd; but the worst on't was, they were
eclips'd by an astonishing Fondness for his Wife,
to whom he was so blindly complaisant, that all
the good People at Court despis'd and hated
him.</p>

<p>This Lady has play'd so extraordinary a Part
in the World, that I can't avoid giving you some
Account of her Origin and Character. Her Father,<!--016.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
one <i>Rickers</i>, was a Bargeman at <i>Emmerick</i>, a
Town in the Duchy of <i>Cleves</i>, where for better
Subsistance he kept a sort of Tavern. He had
two Daughters, who pass'd for fine Women, that
brought a good deal of Company to his House,
and in a Journey which the Elector made to <i>Cleves,
Bidekan</i> his Valet de Chambre fell in love with
the eldest, the Lady I am speaking of, marry'd
her and took her with him to <i>Berlin</i>, where she
fell so passionately in love with <i>Kolbe</i>, that after
having been his Mistress in her Husband's
Life-time, he was hardly cold in his Grave but
she became his Wife. The Wedding was kept
at the House of one <i>Commesser</i>, another of the Elector's
Valets de Chambre, where that Prince
was present, with seven or eight Persons in his
Company; and from that very Juncture he began
to shew such great Marks of Complaisance
to the Lady, that several People thought she
ow'd them to something more than to the Friendship
he had for his Favorite. Nevertheless I
am very well persuaded they were mistaken; and
I remember, that when I was Gentleman of the
Bed-chamber to the Elector, he said to me in
one of his ill Humors with his Favorite and his
Wife (and in these sort of Pets he was not capable
of dissembling) <i>I know the Notion that prevails
of my being under certain Tyes to <span class="f">Kolbe's</span> Lady,
but there is nothing in it</i>; <i>and the Wrong is
greater to me than to her</i>. For really was it not
enough for a Woman of such mean Extraction,
Parts and Beauty too, to be the Wife of a Minister,
but she must also be ambitious to be the
Mistress of a Sovereign? Yet it must be confess'd,
that whether it was meer Humor, or a weak Attachment
to the Favorite, the Elector heap'd
Wealth and Honors upon this Lady, insomuch
that nothing would serve him but she must be admitted<!--017.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
to the Electoress's Circle, who at that
time indeed obstinately refus'd it; for who is
there would not have been disgusted to have seen
the Daughter of <i>Rickers</i> the Bargeman mixing
with Ladies of Quality that had a Right to be
in the Circle? However, some time after, the
Electoress was oblig'd to wave all the Pleas of Decorum,
for the sake of the Need she stood in of
the Great Chamberlain; and his Wife had the
Honor of the Circle.</p>

<p>The same Year that <i>Kolbe</i> was declared Prime
Minister, the Emperor made him a Count of the
Empire. He then chang'd his Name for that
of Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>, which was the Name of
a ruinous Castle that he had in the <i>Palatinate</i>.
His Lady, when she became a Countess, had a
mind that her Children by her first Marriage should
be promoted to the Dignity of Barons; and they
were accordingly call'd Barons of <i>Asbach</i>. But these
new Titles of the Count and Barons compleatly
turn'd the Head of Madame <i>de Wartemberg</i>, and
she was every day guilty of Extravagancies which
were disgusting and ridiculous.</p>

<p>Such, <i>Madame</i>, was the State of our Court in
my early years. It began to shew its Superiority
over almost all the Courts of <i>Germany</i>, by the Influence
it had upon the Affairs of <i>Europe</i>: But that
which added new Lustre to it, was the erecting
the Duchy of <i>Prussia</i> into a Kingdom. The
first Hint of this was given by <i>France</i> to <i>Frederic-William</i>;
but that Elector, whether it was owing
to some Obstacles that he foresaw, or to the little
Advantage he thought to reap from it, was
not willing to put the Project in execution. His
Son too perhaps would have miscarried in it,
had it not been for the Situation of Affairs in
<i>Europe</i>, on account of the <i>Spanish</i> Succession.
<i>Kolbe</i>, whom I shall hereafter call the Count of<!--018.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<i>Wartemberg</i>, had all the Honour of this Event,
because it happen'd in his Ministry. I had some
Particulars, <i>Madame</i>, from his own Mouth,
which I think important enough to have a place
in these Memoirs. The Affair is moreover so
weighty of it self that I shall trace it from its
very beginning.</p>

<p>Great Events commonly have their Source in
Trifles. This was owing to nothing more than the
Refusal of the Prince of <i>Orange</i>, who was King
of <i>England</i>, to give an Arm-Chair to the Elector
in a Conference betwixt those two Princes at the
<i>Hague</i> in 1695. The Elector cou'd not bear
that the Prince of <i>Orange</i>, who had always been
his Inferior, shou'd carry it to him in such a lofty
manner, after Fortune had rais'd him to the
Throne of <i>England</i>; and from that time he resolved
to be a King too.</p>

<p><i>Dankelman</i> the then Prime Minister, who
cou'd not foresee the Situation that <i>Europe</i> was
in some Years after, would fain have diverted
the Elector from a Project which he thought a
perfect Chimæra; he put him in mind of the
Difficulties <i>Frederic-William</i> met with in it, and
of the Reasons he had to refuse the Offers which
<i>France</i> made to him on that head; he shew'd
him that the same Reasons were still subsisting,
and reinforc'd by yet greater Difficulties; and
that it was Madness to attempt a Thing, the Success
whereof was neither certain nor advantageous,
his Rank being so near a-kin to Royalty, that he
would be never the better for the Title. But the
Elector had the refusal of the Arm-chair too
much at heart to hearken to any Reasons that
could be brought against his Design, and sent
<i>Dankelman</i>, his Minister's Brother, to <i>Vienna</i>,<!--019.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to impart to the Emperor the Scheme which he
had form'd to erect <i>Prussia</i> into a Kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Prussia</i>, which is a Province detach'd from
<i>Poland</i>, formerly belong'd to the <i>Lithuanians</i>,
from whom it was conquer'd by the <i>Teutonic</i>
Order. <i>Albert</i> Margrave of <i>Brandenburg</i>, the
Grand Master of the said Order, who had marry'd
<i>Dorothy</i>, Daughter of <i>Frederic</i> I. King of
<i>Denmark</i>, took it from those Knights in 1511,
and made himself Master of it. This engag'd
him in a War with <i>Sigismond</i> I. King of <i>Poland</i>,
his Uncle by the Mother's side, who had Pretensions
upon the said Province; which War
continu'd five Years, till it was concluded by a
Treaty, whereby it was stipulated, That the
Eastern <i>Prussia</i> shou'd remain hereditary with the
Title of a Duchy to <i>Albert</i>, who, together with his
Descendants shou'd perform Allegiance and Homage
for it to the King and Republic of <i>Poland</i>,
to which it was to revert on the failure of Issue
Male in the Family of <i>Albert</i>.</p>

<p>The Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. oppos'd this Transaction,
by pretending that <i>Prussia</i> was a Fief of
the Empire; and that therefore <i>Sigismond</i> had
no Right to dispose of it. The Imperial Decree
which was pass'd upon this Occasion, had however
no Effect, by reason of the Wars which
the Emperor was at that time engag'd in, and
<i>Albert</i> remain'd in peaceable Possession of <i>Prussia</i>.
He was succeeded by his only Son <i>Albert-Frederic</i>,
who receiv'd the Investiture of it from
the King of <i>Poland</i>, for himself and his Cousin-Germans
in 1569. This Prince dying without
Issue, <i>John Sigismond</i> Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i>
succeeded him, and again receiv'd the Investiture
of it from the King of <i>Poland</i>, for himself and
his three Brothers. Since that time the Duchy<!--020.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of <i>Prussia</i> has always been in the <i>Brandenburg</i>
Family from Father to Son; but the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>
the Great, having made War upon
<i>Charles-Gustavus</i> King of <i>Sweden</i>, in favour of
the Crown and Republic of <i>Poland</i>, the Sovereignty
of <i>Prussia</i> was, in Acknowledgment
thereof, yielded to him, for himself and all his
Male Descendants, by the Treaty of <i>Bydgost</i> in
1659.</p>

<p>By virtue of this Treaty, the Elector claim'd
that <i>Prussia</i> depended on no other Power; and
that he held it immediately by Divine Right;
and upon this Plea he thought himself authoriz'd
to be declar'd King. But before he took this
Step, it was necessary to secure the Consent of a
Part, at least, of the Princes of the Empire. As
the Emperor's Consent was not only the most
important, but the most difficult to obtain, the
whole stress of the Negociation lay almost at the
Court of <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>Dankelman</i> arriv'd there, he did not
find the Court in a Temper to grant it. The
august Title of a King conferr'd upon an Elector,
was at first thought to be prejudicial to the Imperial
Authority, and it was look'd upon as exposing
of that Dignity, to acquiesce in the Elector's
Demand before they had at least felt the
Pulses of the Generality of the Princes of <i>Europe</i>,
and especially those of the Empire. 'Twas
but reasonable to imagine the Pope would oppose
it strenuously upon the score of the Protestant
Religion, which by the Elector's Advancement
might gather fresh Strength. All Kings in
general were interested not to suffer an Instance
which had a seeming Tendency to authorize every
Prince to take the same Step, on the single
Pretence of being possess'd of a Bit of Land, and<!--021.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
holding it of no Power but God. But the Persons
from whom the greatest Objections were
expected, were the Electors; and indeed they
had reason to fear, 1. That when the Elector of
<i>Brandenburg</i> came to be a King, he wou'd no
longer look upon them as his Equals, but wou'd
claim certain Distinctions from them in the Empire
and in the Dyets. 2. That he would withdraw
the Dominions of his Electorate from the
Obedience of the Empire, and from the Laws
to which all the other Electors were subject. This
Article was of the utmost consequence to them,
especially with regard to the Contingent they are
oblig'd to furnish towards Wars which concern
the Empire, and which are the more burthensome,
the fewer Heads they fall upon.</p>

<p>These being then the Notions of the Court of
<i>Vienna</i>, <i>Dankelman</i> had no great Hopes of succeeding
in his Negociation. Nevertheless the
Court always took care to keep fair with the Elector,
whom they look'd upon as an Ally that
was well worth preserving; and perhaps they
flatter'd themselves they should get more by Promises
and Expectations than by granting him
his Demand.</p>

<p>The Death of <i>John Sobieski</i> King of <i>Poland</i>,
which happen'd on the 17th of <i>June</i> 1696,
was another Inducement to the Emperor to pursue
the same Politics. The Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i>
by having <i>Prussia</i> in his Neighbourhood,
might be of great Weight in the Election of a
new King of <i>Poland</i>; and the Emperor who had
a Design to advance the Margrave <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Baden</i>
to the Throne, pretended to enter into the Views
of the Elector, that this Prince might afterwards
fall in with his at the Dyet of Election. For this
end the Emperor's Ministers gave <i>Dankelman</i> to<!--022.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
understand, that the first thing to be done was
to clear the Difficulties which the several Powers
of <i>Europe</i> might raise against the Elector's Project;
and that the Congress of <i>Ryswic</i>, at which
all the Ministers were to be present, was the most
favourable Opportunity.</p>

<p>Hereupon <i>Dankelman</i> was recall'd from the
Court of <i>Vienna</i>, and sent to <i>Ryswic</i> as Plenipotentiary
from the Elector, jointly with M. <i>de
Schmettau</i>. The Elector for his part set out for
<i>Konigsberg</i>, the Capital of <i>Prussia</i>, that he might
be nearer at hand to favor the Election of the
Margrave <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Baden</i>. Mean time he was
strenuously sollicited in favor of <i>Alexander</i> and
<i>Constantine</i> Princes of <i>Poland</i>, who for that reason
came themselves to <i>Berlin</i>; but the Elector was
far from breaking the secret Engagements which
he had made with the Emperor: Therefore he
answer'd the Solicitations of those two Princes
in a very ambiguous manner, by engaging himself
to nothing, and only telling them that he
was going into <i>Prussia</i> that he might be the better
inform'd of every thing that pass'd at the
Dyet of Election.</p>

<p>The Necessity which the Elector stood in of
<i>Poland</i> to succeed in his Views, laid him under
an indispensible Obligation to concern himself in
that Election. He fully expected that the Right
which the said Republic claim'd to <i>Prussia</i> wou'd
induce it to oppose his Designs with Vigor;
and besides, under the Pretext of interesting himself
in the Election of a King, he might form a
Party that hereafter would be capable to serve
him; therefore, as soon as he arriv'd at <i>Konigsberg</i>,
he dispatch'd a Messenger to the Cardinal
<i>Radziowsky</i> Primate of <i>Poland</i>, to acquaint
him of his Arrival, and sent M. <i>Dorerbeck</i><!--023.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Great Cup-bearer of <i>Prussia</i> as his Ambassador
to the Dyet of Election, with Orders to support
the Interests of the Margrave <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Baden</i>, but
in the mean time to do nothing that might disoblige
the <i>Poles</i>.</p>

<p>The Margrave <i>Lewis</i> of <i>Baden</i> was soon out
of the Question; for the two strongest Parties
oblig'd him to retire, as well as the other Competitors
for the Crown. These two Parties were
the one for <i>Frederic-Augustus</i> Elector of <i>Saxony</i>,
and the other for the Prince of <i>Conti</i>. The
Cardinal Primate favor'd the latter, and <i>France</i>
seem'd to have his Election very much at heart;
yet <i>Frederic-Augustus</i>'s Party carried it, and he
was proclaim'd King.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Primate was still obstinate for
the Prince of <i>Conti</i>, and actually sent one of his
near Relations to the Elector to sollicit him in
his Favor; but the Elector, who thought the Elector
of <i>Saxony</i>'s Party the most substantial and
the most powerful, did not scruple to own him
for King, and return'd for Answer to the Cardinal,
That he advis'd him, as the Chief Pastor of
<i>Poland</i>, to maintain Peace in his Flock, and to
submit to the Elector of <i>Saxony</i>. Nevertheless
the Primate stood out stiffly, and form'd a Party
in <i>Poland</i>, considerable enough to give the new
King Uneasiness. The Elector still persevering
in his Views to make himself necessary to <i>Poland</i>,
return'd next year to <i>Konigsberg</i>, in hopes of appeasing
the Disturbances rais'd there by the two
different Parties. <i>Kolbe</i>, who was not yet Count
of <i>Wartemberg</i>, but only Great Chamberlain, made
a Journey to <i>Warsaw</i> for this purpose, on the
part of the Elector, and complimented the King
on his Accession to the Crown. The King in
his Turn sent the Count <i>de Bilinsky</i> Great Chamberlain<!--024.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of the Crown to the Elector, to
compliment him on his Arrival at <i>Konigsberg</i>,
and there to negociate an Interview betwixt
them. The Elector wish'd for it too heartily
to refuse it, and <i>Fredericshoss</i>, one of his
Pleasure-houses, was chose for the place of Meeting.
There every thing pass'd, as is common
upon those Occasions; a great deal of Business
was talk'd of, and referred to the Ministers for
Conclusion. The two Princes made each other
magnificent Presents, and exchang'd all the Tokens
of the sincerest Friendship. This Union
seem'd still increasing by the Sale which the King
of <i>Poland</i> made this year to the Elector of the
Fee for protecting the Abbey-Town of <i>Quedlimbourg</i>,
which no Elector of <i>Saxony</i> would ever
part with before, whatsoever Instances were made
to them by the Family of <i>Brandenburg</i>. The
Elector had less Reason than any of his Predecessors
to hope for Success in this Affair. <i>Poland</i>,
besides the Pleas of Interest, had others of
Resentment; and this Prince's Conduct in the
affair of <i>Elbing</i> bid fair to set the King and the
Elector at variance. The Dispute was about a
Demand of 400,000 Crowns which the Elector
made upon <i>Poland</i>, for the Expences of the War,
which his Father, <i>Frederic-William</i> the Great,
had carry'd on in favor of the Republic against
<i>Charles</i> XI. King of <i>Sweden</i>. The King of <i>Poland</i>
in the Interview at <i>Fredericshoff</i> had promis'd
to persuade the Republic to pay that Sum.
The Elector whose Patience was worn out in
Expectation of the Performance, notwithstanding
the many Reasons he had to keep fair with <i>Poland</i>,
caused the City of <i>Elbing</i>, which had been
mortgag'd to him for that Sum, to be invested.
And M. <i>de Brantz</i>, my Uncle, who was Lieutenant-General,<!--025.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
was sent upon this Expedition,
at the Head of a Body of 12000 Men.</p>

<p>The <i>Poles</i> no sooner heard of it but they made
a very great Clamor, and the King complain'd
loudly of the Elector's Proceeding, who being,
<i>said he</i>, his Cousin, his Friend, and Ally, ought
to have had more Regard for him. 'Twas at
least after this manner that he express'd himself
in the Circular Letters, which he wrote to assemble
the Nobility of <i>Poland</i>. But the Elector went
on still his own way, and the City of <i>Elbing</i>
was taken before the <i>Poles</i> had so much as a
Thought of defending it. As soon as the King
of <i>Poland</i> was told of it, he ordered the Elector's
Resident to depart the City of <i>Thorn</i> in
24 Hours, and the Kingdom without Delay.
M. <i>de Reitwitz</i>, Envoy of <i>Poland</i> to the Elector,
fearing the same Treatment, was absent from
Court for a Fortnight; but return'd then,
causing his Appearance to be notify'd to the
Ministers, not as Envoy from the King of <i>Poland</i>,
but as Envoy from the Elector of <i>Saxony</i>.
By this piece of Management 'tis plain that the
King of <i>Poland</i> did not take the Affair of <i>Elbing</i>
so much to heart as he seem'd to do; and some
time after the Matter was accommodated; the
Elector consenting to lose one fourth of the Debt,
and the <i>Poles</i> promising to pay the rest at the
Expiration of three Months, and depositing their
King's Crown for Security. The Elector on his
part restor'd <i>Elbing</i> on condition nevertheless,
that he should have it again at the three Month's
end, if the 300,000 Crowns were not then paid.
This Affair has ever since remain'd <i>in statu quo</i>:
The <i>Poles</i> are still Debtors for that Sum, and the
Elector contents himself with detaining the
Crown, which is still at <i>Berlin</i>, in the Gallery<!--026.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
over the great Stables, where 'tis kept in a Case,
seal'd with the Seal of the Kingdom of <i>Poland</i>.</p>

<p>Mean time the Peace of <i>Ryswic</i> was just sign'd,
and sooner than expected, by reason <i>France</i> receded
from several Pretensions; which every
body knows she was induc'd to do from the
View she had at that time to the <i>Spanish</i> Succession,
and to that end it was absolutely necessary
for her to make a Peace with that Power and to
disarm the Allies. Consequently Messieurs <i>Dankelman</i>
and <i>Schmettau</i> had no time to push the Negociation
of the Affair of <i>Prussia</i> any farther;
nevertheless they acted with the <i>Dutch</i> to some
purpose.</p>

<p>The Elector had sent <i>Bartholdi</i> to <i>Vienna</i> in
the place of <i>Dankelman</i>, and M. <i>Blaspiel</i> to <i>Dusseldorff</i>
to the Elector <i>Palatine</i>, whom he thought
proper to treat with extraordinary Regard, as
well upon his own Account, as with relation to
the Empress his Sister who had a very great Ascendant
over the Emperor.</p>

<p><i>Bartholdi</i> when he arriv'd at <i>Vienna</i> found the
Court in the very same Disposition as it was in
the time of <i>Dankelman</i>. There was a great shew
of Good-will, but no Advance made; for the
Emperor's Ministers were never at a loss for a
Reason to defer coming to the Point. The Republic
of <i>Poland</i> furnish'd very cogent ones too,
by the Protestations it made against every Step
taken towards erecting <i>Prussia</i> into a Kingdom,
on pretence that it formerly belong'd to the
Republic, and that the <i>Poles</i> only suffer'd it to
fall to the House of <i>Brandenburg</i>, on condition
of its reverting to them on the Failure of Issue
Male in that Family. The Emperor said he could
not help having Regard to those Protestations, the
Alliance which he had been in for a long time<!--027.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
with the Republic being become much firmer
since the raising the Siege of <i>Vienna</i>, when <i>John
Sobiesky</i> at the Head of the <i>Poles</i> so effectually
reliev'd it. <i>Bartholdi</i> being dishearten'd with all
these Delays, began to despair of the Success of
the Negociation. He flatter'd himself for a
while that the languishing State of <i>Charles</i> II.
King of <i>Spain</i>, which presag'd his approaching
Death, and the cruel War between the Houses of
<i>Austria</i> and <i>Bourbon</i>, on account of the <i>Spanish</i>
Succession, would promote the Success of his Master's
Designs; and that the State Policy which
at that Juncture oblig'd the Emperor to strengthen
himself with Allies, would make him chuse to
retain in his Party a Prince so powerful and so
necessary to his Interests as the Elector. But
<i>Bartholdi</i> was deceiv'd; and whether the Court
of <i>Vienna</i> flatter'd itself that the Elector wou'd
never venture to take the part of <i>France</i>, or whether
they thought it more nearly concern'd them
to humor the Powers that oppos'd the Elector's
Views, they had always some fresh Pretence or
other to trump up.</p>

<p><i>Bartholdi</i> cou'd not avoid giving an Account
to the Elector his Master of what he thought of
these continual Delays, and he told him there
was no manner of Reason to hope that the Emperor
would recognize him for King before he
was sure of the Consent of the Pope, and of all
the Princes of the Empire; that it was easy to
see this was only a civil Excuse that the Emperor
made use of for his Refusal, rather than to
make him his Enemy; and that the Case was
really so desperate, that he knew of but one Stratagem
to make use of before he retir'd; and that
was that he shou'd write with his own Hand to
the Prince of &mdash;&mdash;, who, said <i>Bartholdi</i>, was the<!--028.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
only Person in the World to induce the Emperor
to be more favorable. His Dispatch was written
in a Cypher, and the Secretary who decypher'd
it, thought he met with the Name of the Emperor's
Confessor, instead of that of the Prince of
----. The Elector approv'd of his Minister's
Hint, and wrote immediately to the Confessor,
who happen'd to be a Jesuit. This Reverend
Father was overjoy'd to find himself courted by
one of the greatest Protestant Princes, and promising
himself that he should reap considerable
Advantages for his Society, from the Success of
a Negociation which the Elector had so much
at heart, and in which two of his most able
Ministers had already miscarried, he made no
scruple to undertake it.</p>

<p>As soon as he began to meddle with it, it assum'd
a new Face; the Court of <i>Rome</i> made but
a faint Opposition to it: That of <i>Vienna</i> being
alarmed at the News they received from the
Count <i>de Harrach</i> their Ambassador at <i>Madrid</i>,
of the bad State of the King of <i>Spain</i>'s Health,
and of the <i>Spaniards</i> Byass for the Duke of <i>Anjou</i>,
became more tractable; and the very Reasons
that <i>Bartholdi</i> urg'd in vain, began to be relish'd
when they were represented by the Confessor. This
Jesuit convinc'd the Emperor, that as he was
resolv'd to dispute the Succession to the Crown
of <i>Spain</i> with <i>France</i>, such an Ally as the Elector
would give great Weight to either of the two
Parties that he fell in with. The Confessor's
Arguments were applauded by some, and faintly
rejected by others; so that the Father, by
craftily taking advantage of the Good-Will of
the latter, and of the Lethargy of the former,
brought the Affair of <i>Prussia</i> in less than two<!--029.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Month's Time to the Point of a happy Conclusion.</p>

<p>While such effectual Endeavors were us'd for
the Elector at the Court of <i>Vienna</i>, his Interest
was as successfully manag'd with the King of
<i>England</i>. The Electoress, together with her
Mother the Electoress of <i>Hanover</i>, went to pay
him a Visit at <i>Aix la Chapelle</i>; and in that Interview,
these two Princesses prevail'd on King <i>William</i>
of <i>England</i> to recognize the Elector of
<i>Brandenburg</i> for King of <i>Prussia</i>, and to call the
House of <i>Hanover</i> to the Succession of the Crown
of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>One particular Circumstance in this Journey
that prov'd of such Service to the Elector's Designs,
and which many People look'd upon as
a politic Action, is, that it would not have been
undertaken, had it not been for the extreme
Fondness of Madame <i>de Wartemberg</i> to be admitted
in the Electoress's Circle. This Princess
upon the Intelligence she receiv'd that her Mother
the Electoress of <i>Hanover</i> was going to <i>Aix
la Chapelle</i>, was very desirous to go with her,
but she cou'd not hope to obtain the Elector's
Consent to it, nor to have Money enough with
her to bear her Expences, if the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>
oppos'd it; and therefore she charg'd
Madamoiselle <i>de Pollnitz</i> my Cousin to speak to
him about it. The Count <i>de Wartemberg</i> promis'd
not only to obtain the Elector's Consent, but also
to give the Electoress an Order at large to take
up any Sums of Money that she should want,
provided that Princess would on her part only
acknowledge the Favor, by granting his Wife
the Honor of Admittance to her Circle. The
Electoress had this Journey so much at heart,
because she knew it wou'd give her the Pleasure<!--030.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of seeing a Mother whom she tenderly lov'd,
as well as a Freedom, for some time at least, from
the Constraint she was oblig'd to live in at <i>Berlin</i>,
that she consented to the Count's Demand. Madame
<i>de Wartemberg</i> was admitted to the Circle,
and all the Mortification the Electoress gave her,
was always to talk to her in <i>French</i>, which being
a Language she did not understand, plainly shew'd
the Obscurity of the Countess's Birth; for at
that Time all Persons of any Rank or Figure
convers'd in that Language commonly at our
Court. The Electoress's Condescension upon
this Occasion is the only thing for which she was
to blame; for 'twas a Precedent which gave others
Authority to desire the same Favor; and
to this may be said to be owing the unequal
Matches which several of the Nobility made afterwards.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>, in order to obtain
the Elector's Consent, gave him to understand
that the Princess his Consort cou'd do more than
any body to prevail with the King of <i>England</i>
to recognize him for King. This was touching
him in the most sensible part; and therefore he
made no Scruple to let the Electoress go, who
went and met her Mother at <i>Aix la Chapelle</i>,
and from thence they set out afterwards for <i>Brussels</i>.
There they stay'd a few days, in order to
disguise the Motives of their Journey, and from
thence they went to <i>Loo</i>, where the King of <i>England</i>
was. They each obtain'd of the Prince
what they went to ask him; the House of <i>Hanover</i>
was soon after call'd to the Succession of
the Crown of <i>England</i>, and the King gave his
Promise, that as soon as the Emperor had own'd
the Elector King of <i>Prussia</i>, he wou'd be one of
the first to follow his Example.<!--031.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the News reach'd <i>Vienna</i> that the
King of <i>England</i> had promis'd to recognize the
Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i> King of <i>Prussia</i>, the remaining
Difficulties were soon got over; the
Protestations of the Republic of <i>Poland</i> were superseded,
and the Emperor declar'd at length
that he own'd <i>Prussia</i> for a Kingdom, and the
Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i> for King; on condition
however,</p>

<p>1. That the Elector should never withdraw
from the Empire the Provinces of his Dominions
thereon depending.</p>

<p>2. That in the Emperor's Presence he should
require no other Distinctions than those which he
actually enjoy'd now.</p>

<p>3. That his Imperial Majesty when he wrote
to him should only give him the Title of your
<i>Royal Dilection</i>.</p>

<p>4. That nevertheless his Ministers at <i>Vienna</i>
should be treated on a Par with those of Crown'd
Heads.</p>

<p>5. That the Elector should maintain six thousand
Men in <i>Italy</i> at his own expence, in case
the Emperor should be oblig'd to go to War for
the <i>Spanish</i> Succession.</p>

<p>6. That those Troops should remain there as
long as the War continu'd.</p>

<p>Thus, Madame, after tedious delays the Court
of <i>Vienna</i> consented at last to the Success of this
great Event, which after all ow'd its cause to the
refusal of an Arm-chair, and its issue to the mistake
of a Secretary. Nevertheless it did not fail
to cost the Elector six Millions, of which the Jesuits
of <i>Vienna</i> had 200,000 Crowns to their
share.</p>

<p>This agreeable News was scarce arriv'd at <i>Berlin</i>
when they heard of the Death of the King<!--032.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of <i>Spain</i>, which happen'd the 1st of <i>November</i>,
1700. His Death was notify'd to the Elector
by M. <i>Desalleurs</i>, Envoy of <i>France</i> to our Court,
as was also the Will whereby the Duke of <i>Anjou</i>
was call'd to the Succession of all the late King's
Dominions. The Elector had entered into such
Engagements with the Emperor, that he could
not own him; for which reason the King of
<i>France</i> recall'd M. <i>Desalleurs</i>, and likewise refus'd
to acknowledge the Elector for King, who in his
turn recall'd M. <i>Spanheim</i>, and sent him to <i>England</i>
with the Title of Ambassador.</p>

<p>The Elector was so urgent to be crown'd, that
he hasten'd to <i>Konigsberg</i>, the capital City of
<i>Prussia</i>, without staying for the fine Season of the
Year; having fix'd on the 17th of <i>December</i> for
his Departure thither with the whole Court. My
Mother would also have been one of the Company,
but she was too far gone with Child. She
was now marry'd to her third Husband, who was
the Count <i>de Wesen</i>; and the Nuptials were perform'd
at <i>Konigsberg</i> in 1698, when the Elector
was there about the Election of the King of <i>Poland</i>.
This was a Match, in the making of
which, neither Love nor Interest had the least
share: M. <i>de Wesen</i>, tho' come of a very good
Family in the Duchy of <i>Zell</i>, was Heir but to a
very small Estate, and that he was obliged to divide
with a great many Brothers; and my Mother
before he marry'd her had never so much as
spoke to him, nor had she seen him but while he
was in the Office of Chief Steward. The Elector
himself made the Match at the solicitation of
Madame <i>de Wartemberg</i> who had a very great
kindness for M. <i>Wesen</i> formerly, and perhaps
had so still, and by helping him to a rich Widow,
she was willing to make him a recompence for the<!--033.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Respect he had paid to her. There was no necessity
of using powerful Arguments with the Elector,
to engage him to bring this Match about.
It was his Foible to make Matches, and were
they good or bad, provided he saw the Weddings,
'twas all alike to him. Consequently, as soon as
Madame <i>de Wartemberg</i> had proposed this Marriage
to him, he promis'd to mention it himself
to my Mother; nay, more than that, he came to
her House and made the Proposal. My Mother
desir'd to be excus'd, saying to his Highness, that
she had been already married twice, that she had
two Sons by her first Husband, and that she did
not care to hazard their Interests and her own
Peace by engaging herself in Matrimony a third
time. The Elector made her answer, that he
would have it so, and that her Children, so far
from Losers, should be Gainers by it, because he
would take care of them. He added that he
would allow her twenty-four Hours time to consider
of it, and then he left her, forbidding her to
stir to the Door, and promising to come and see
her again next day, in order to have her Answer.
He then went into my Grandmother's Chamber,
and said so many fine things to her, in favor of
the Son-in-Law he had in his eye for her, that
she was for it by all means.</p>

<p>My Mother continued very wavering till next
day, when the Elector return'd as he had promis'd:
And as 'tis not an easy matter to resist
the Orders of one's Sovereign, my Mother, tho'
still against a new Engagement in her heart, seemed
however to consent to the Marriage, which in
a few days after was celebrated, and honour'd
with the presence of the Elector, who had the
goodness to assure my Brother and me that it
should not be the worse for us. Mean time all my<!--034.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Relations exclaim'd against my Mother, and
when she return'd to <i>Berlin</i> not a Soul of them
went to see her. My Grandmother by my Father's
side was loudest in her Complaint; for her
great Age and the Honour she had of attending
the late Electoress, Mother to the Elector, made
her take the freedom to tell that Prince her
mind. She was in a passion with him even to a
degree of Childishness, telling him that it griev'd
her to the heart that she was not strong enough
to twist the neck of the Man that he had
given to her Daughter-in-Law for a Husband.
The Elector to pacify her, promis'd her that he
would be such a friend to M. <i>de Wesen</i>, that this
Marriage instead of being a prejudice should be
an advantage to us. And as soon as he had left
her, he declared him Marshal of his Court.</p>

<p>This Office obliging my Father-in-law to follow
the Prince in his Travels, he left my Mother
at <i>Berlin</i>, and carry'd me with him to <i>Konigsberg</i>,
to shew me the Ceremony of the Elector's Coronation.</p>

<p>His Court was so numerous that upon the
Road from <i>Berlin</i> to <i>Konigsberg</i>, which is reckon'd
fourscore <i>German</i> Miles, there were no less than
thirty thousand Hackney-Horses, besides those
belonging to the Stables of the King and Princes.
The King, who was excessively fond of Ceremony,
omitted nothing that could be an addition
to the splendor of his Coronation. This Ceremony
cost him immense Sums of Money, and
convinc'd Foreigners who came thither from a
curiosity to see it, that our Court was inferior to
few others for Magnificence.</p>

<p>Tho' one would think the preparations for
such a solemn Festival must take up a tedious
deal of time, yet the King's Impatience hurry'd<!--035.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
them so fast that every thing was ready by the
eighteenth of <i>January</i>, about a Fortnight after
the Arrival of the Court. The Proclamation for
erecting <i>Prussia</i> into a Kingdom was made two
Days before the King's Coronation, with the
sound of the Cannon, and all the Bells of the
City, by four Heralds at Arms in Mantles of blue
Velvet with the Royal Arms thereon embroider'd,
and riding upon Horses richly accouter'd, the
Housings being of Silver-Brocade, sprinkled with
Eagles and Coronets of Gold. They went with
a very numerous Train to the chief Quarters of
the City, and there made Proclamation in these
terms:</p>

<p><i>Whereas it has pleased the Divine Providence
to erect this Sovereign Duchy of <span class="f">Prussia</span> into a
Kingdom, and to set up for our King the most
High and most Potent Prince <span class="f">Frederic I.</span> our
gracious Sovereign; we have thought fit to give
notice thereof to the People of this Kingdom,
that they may say as we do, "Long live <span class="f">Frederic</span>,
our most Merciful and most Gracious King! Long
live <span class="f">Sophia-Charlotte</span>, our most Gracious Queen."</i></p>

<p>The King to render the Ceremony of his Coronation
still more august, instituted the Day before<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
the Order of the <i>Black Eagle</i>, the Badges
of which are an Orange Ribband with a Cross
hanging to it enamell'd with Blue, in form of the
Cross of <i>Malta</i>: In a Star of Silver which is embroider'd
upon the Coat, there is a black Eagle
which gripes in one Claw a Crown, and in the
other a Scepter; and round the 'Scutcheon are
these words, <i>SUUM CUIQUE</i>, (i. e. to every<!--036.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
one his own.) The principal Statutes of
this Order are, 1. That the Number of the
Knights shall not exceed thirty, exclusive of the
Princes of the Royal Family, and Sovereign Princes.
2. That the Knights shall prove their
Nobility by sixteen Descents. 3. That they shall
promise to be just, chaste, and to protect and support
Widows and Orphans, according to their
motto, <i>Suum cuique</i>.</p>

<p>Tho' it was contrary to custom, to install the
Knights before the Coronation, the King was
not so scrupulous as to conform to it, foreseeing that
the Ceremony of his Coronation receiv'd a new
Lustre from this Foundation. Nevertheless the
Knights and Officers of the Order had then no
other Badges but the Ribband and Star embroider'd
on their Clothes; and 'twas not till two Years
after that the King gave to the new Knights, for
days of Ceremony, a Dress consisting of a Vest of
Cloth of Gold, with another over it of Sky-blue Velvet,
reaching down to the Mid-leg, with a Lining
of Straw-color, and ty'd under the Cravat with
yellow Ribbands, the Tassels of which hang down
to the Knees. Their Sash is of Straw-color'd Velvet,
embroider'd with Gold. Their Mantle is
also of Straw-color'd Velvet, lin'd with Gold-Mohair,
and over it is a Collar of Gold enamell'd
with blue, forming these two Letters <i>F. R.</i> to signify
<i>Fredericus Rex</i>: This is call'd the Grand
Collar of the Order. The Knights wear black
Velvet Caps on their Heads, with white Plumes
of Feathers. The King's Habit differs not from
that of the Knights; but the Habits of the Grand
Master of the Ceremonies, the Secretary, and the
Treasurer, differ in that they only wear over their
common Clothes full Gowns of Straw-color'd
Velvet, with an Orange-color'd Lining, and upon<!--037.png--><span class="pagenum">31</span>
them the Cross of the Order, fasten'd only by an
Orange-color'd Ribband that hangs to their Neck.</p>

<p>The King at the first Promotion, or rather on
the day that he instituted the Order, created the
full number of Knights, prescribed by the Statutes.
He also gave the Ribband of the Order to the Electoral
Prince his Son, and to his two Brothers
the Margraves <i>Christian</i> and <i>Albert</i>. The Margrave
<i>Philip</i> staying behind at <i>Berlin</i> to govern
in the King's Absence, the Ribband was sent to
him by a Gentleman of the Bed-chamber.</p>

<p>On the Coronation-day, about nine in the Morning
the King was dressed by the great Chamberlain,
attended by all the Officers of the Bed-chamber.
His Coat was Scarlet embroider'd with
Gold, and brilliant Diamonds were his Buttons.
Over that, he had a Royal Mantle of Crimson-Velvet,
lin'd and turn'd up with Ermin, which
was fasten'd to his Breast by a Clasp of three
Diamonds. As soon as the King was dressed he
went into a Hall in his Apartment, where a
Throne had been erected, on each side of which,
there lay on two Tables of Silver the Royal Ornaments
that were to serve the King and Queen.
The King being seated on his Throne, ordered
they should be brought to him, and they were
accordingly presented to him on the Knee. Having
the Crown in his Hand, he put it himself on
his Head, and then taking the Sceptre in his
right Hand and the Royal Globe in his left, in
that posture he receiv'd the first Homages of the
Prince Royal and of the Margraves, who bent
one Knee before him. After this the King arose
and went to the Queen's Apartment, preceded
by the Knights of the Order, the two Margraves,
the Prince Royal, and the Noblemen that carried
the Regalia design'd for the Queen.<!--038.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>Her Majesty was dress'd in a Purple Gown,
and a Royal Mantle like the King's. She was
dress'd in her own Nut-brown Hair without any
Powder, which in conjunction with the Lustre of
the Diamonds gave her an Air still more noble
and majestic. As soon as she perceiv'd the King,
who met her at the entrance of his Chamber, she
fell on her knees, in which situation the King
embrac'd her, and with his own Hands set the
Crown upon her Head. She took the Scepter
and Globe from the hands of the Lords who carried
them, and the King raising her up she follow'd
him into his Apartment, where she also receiv'd
the Homage of the Prince Royal and the
Margraves, in the same manner as they had perform'd
them to the King.</p>

<p>Their Majesties went afterwards to Church
with all the Pomp and Magnificence, (I dare to
say it) of the ancient Kings of <i>Asia</i>. The King
walk'd under a Canopy of Silver-Brocade embroider'd
with Gold borne by ten <i>Prussian</i> Lords
of the first Quality, and at some distance came the
Queen under another Canopy like to that of the
King. The Grand Chamberlain held up the
Train of the King's Mantle, and the Queen's
was born by the Duchess of <i>Holstein</i>, and the
Ladies <i>Stingland</i> and <i>Bulau</i>, the one Lady of
Honour to the Queen, and the other having
the first Reversion of that Office. The Duke
of <i>Holstein</i> officiated as Great Master of her
Houshold; and the Princess of <i>Holstein</i> walk'd
at the head of the Court-Ladies. Their Majesties
were receiv'd by the two Bishops that
were to perform the Ceremony of the Coronation,
who were dress'd in purple Velvet, after the <i>English</i>
mode, and had for their Assistants six Ministers,
three of them <i>Calvinists</i> and three <i>Lutherans</i>.<!--039.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
They conducted the King and Queen
to their Thrones which had been erected on the
two sides of the Altar, the King's on the Right,
and the Queen's on the Left. Tho' there is no
Altar in the <i>Calvinist</i> Churches, the King had
one, and had actually made a present of a magnificent
Crucifix to be plac'd upon it, in order to
shew how much he wish'd the Union of the two
Protestant Churches.</p>

<p>The Prince Royal seated himself a little behind
the King towards the Right on a Folding-chair,
with his Governor the Count <i>de Dobna</i> behind
him: The Margraves also sate in two Folding-chairs
on both sides of the Queen. The Duke
and Duchess of <i>Holstein</i>, and the Ladies <i>Stingland</i>
and <i>Bulau</i>, sate upon Stools immediately behind
the Queen. The Princess of <i>Holstein</i> was also
placed upon a Stool, but a little farther off. On
both sides of the Altar two Galleries were erected,
the one for the Duchess of <i>Courland</i> the King's
Sister, the young Duke her Son, and the three
Princesses her Daughters-in-Law, the other for
the Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers.</p>

<p>When the King was to receive the sacred
Unction, he went and kneel'd at the foot of the
Altar, gave the Globe and Sceptre to the Lords
who had before carried them, took off his Crown
with his own hands, which he plac'd on a Cushion
like to that on which he kneel'd, and then receiv'd
three Unctions, one on the Forehead, and
the two others on his Wrists. The Great Chamberlain
dried up the Oil with Cotton and Linnen,
which one of the Ministers presented to him
on a Plate of Gold. After this the King took
his Crown again which no other hand had touch'd,
and plac'd it himself on his head; and having also
taken the Sceptre and Globe again, he went and<!--040.png--><span class="pagenum">34</span>
replac'd himself on his Throne. The same Ceremonies
were observ'd at the Anointing of the
Queen, with this difference only, that she all the
while kept the Crown on her Head, and that
Madame <i>Stingland</i>, her Lady of Honour, dried
up the Oil.</p>

<p>This done, the two Bishops with the six Ministers
pay'd the first Homage to both the King and
Queen. The Bishop at Consecration said to the
King, <i>May Blessing and Prosperity attend</i> <span class="smcap">Frederic
King of Prussia</span>! <i>May the Lord,
the God of our King say the same! May he continue
his Presence with him as he has done hitherto,
to the end that his Royal Throne may aggrandize
his Power from day to day.</i></p>

<p>The same Bishop said to the Queen, <i>May Blessing
and Prosperity attend</i> <span class="smcap">Sophia-Charlotta
Queen of Prussia</span>! <i>May the Lord our God preserve
her for a Token of his Blessing to her People,
and may she from this time forward see Prosperity
and Salvation spread ever her Royal Family,
and over her Children, in the Peace of</i> Israel!</p>

<p>While the Music as it were repeated these same
words, the Prince Royal and the Margraves went
and paid their Homage also to the King and
Queen, kneeling on the last Step of their Throne
and kissing their Hands. The Homage of the
other Nobility only consisted in their making a
profound Obeysance without stirring out of their
places.</p>

<p>The Bishop who had perform'd the Consecration,
turning about to the People, said with a loud Voice,
<i>Fear God and honour your King and your Queen, for
their Power cometh from the Lord who hath created
Heaven and Earth. May the same Lord vouchsafe
to be their Guide and Guardian! May he cover
them with his Shadow, that the Heat of the</i><!--041.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
<i>Sun and the Rays of the Moon, may never hurt
their Sight! May the Lord keep them from all
Evil? save their Souls, and go in and out before
them with Blessing, till Time Shall be no more.</i>
After some other Prayers, the King renew'd the
Edicts against Duels, and swore to observe them
upon the Holy Gospels. And therewith ended
this long Ceremony.</p>

<p>The King had all the reason in the World to
be pleased with it, by reason of the exactness with
which every one perform'd his Function, which
was a thing hardly to have been expected in a
Ceremony that was quite new to the Performers;
but they so well knew his delicacy in every matter
of Ceremony, and the Emulation they had to
please him in this Taste was such, that the most
consummate Experience could not have acquitted
itself better.</p>

<p>The Queen herself was the only Person that
got a reprimand, and that was by her taking
some Snuff. Her Throne being over-against the
King's, she watch'd a long time for an opportunity,
and when she thought his Majesty did not
observe her she stole out her Snuff-Box. The
King happening to turn his Eyes towards her
the very same moment, she would fain have conceal'd
it, but his Majesty's Countenance was so
fix'd on her that she was convinc'd he perceiv'd
it; and indeed this Prince who was upon this
occasion not to be trifled with, immediately order'd
one of his Gentlemen who was behind him
to go and ask the Queen in his Name, <i>Whether
she remember'd the Place where she was, and the
Rank she held there</i>.</p>

<p>The King and Queen going out of the Church
caus'd Gold and Silver Medals to the value of
ten thousand Crowns to be scatter'd among the<!--042.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
People, which had on one side their Effigies with
these words, <i>FREDERICUS ET SOPHIA-CHARLOTTA,
REX ET REGINA</i>; and on
the reverse a Crown with these words, <i>PRIMA
MEÆ GENTIS</i>.</p>

<p>The Ceremonies at the Royal Feast which follow'd,
were not much short of those at the Coronation.
It was kept in the great Hall of the
Palace, to which the King and Queen repair'd
almost with the same Train, and in the same order
as they had observ'd going to Church.</p>

<p>When they were seated at Table, their Majesties
return'd their Sceptres and Globes into the
hands of the Lords who had the Honour of
carrying them before. These Lords then plac'd
themselves at each side of the Table, and remain'd
there during the whole Feast. The Prince Royal,
the two Margraves and the Duchess of <i>Courland</i>
the King's Sister, were the only Persons that had
the honour of dining with their Majesties. Of
all the Ceremonies that were observ'd there, the
two following are what I have no where seen
but in <i>Germany</i>. As soon as the King and Queen
had taken their Seats at Table, the two Grand
Marshals went out of the Hall into the Courtyard
of the Palace, and from thence rode on
horseback to the great Stables attended by Kettle-drums,
Trumpets, and a great many Officers
of the King's Kitchen. There they found a
whole Ox roasting on a Spit and stuff'd with all
sorts of Wild-fowl, of which they cut off a piece
and carry'd it in a Gold Dish to their Majesties
Table.</p>

<p>After this, the Great Cup-Bearer went with
the like Train to the same Stables, where there
were two Fountains of Wine running from the
Beaks of two Eagles. Of this he fill'd a gold<!--043.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Goblet, and went and presented it to the King.
His Majesty having taken it and return'd it to
him, he presented it afterwards to the Queen,
who return'd it to him in like manner; and then
he carry'd it to the great Beaufet, which was set
up at the other end of the Room over-against the
King's Table. As often as the King or Queen
drank, nine Cannon were fired; six when the
Prince Royal drank, and three whenever the
Margraves and the Duchess of <i>Courland</i> drank.</p>

<p>This Repast held a very long time, yet none
of the Courtiers sate down to Table till their Majesties
were retir'd to their Apartments. About
nine o'clock at Night all the Bells in the City
were rung, and the Noise of the Cannon added
to that of the Kettle-drums and Trumpets, serv'd
as a signal for the Bonfires that were lighted in
all the Cross-streets. The Burghers illuminated
the Fronts of their Houses. Some of the most
substantial had also erected Triumphal Arches
before their Houses, with Emblems and Devices;
others let Wine run for the Populace, and
in short there was no Burgher but strove to signalize
their Joy some way or other.</p>

<p>Their Majesties being desirous to honour the
public Rejoicings with their presence, went into
the Streets about ten o'clock in a magnificent
Coach, accompanied by all their Courtiers on
horseback. When they came before the Town-House
they were harangu'd by the chief Burgo-Master,
who presented them with a Collation in
Panniers of Silver, after which they pass'd by the
House of the Duke of <i>Holstein</i> Governour of <i>Konigsberg</i>.
The Front of the House represented the
Temple of Glory; the Duke's Gentlemen represented
the Priests of the Temple, and threw Amber
and Incense into the Coals which were upon<!--044.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the Altar; the Duke's Children, who were eight
in number, were dressed like Shepherds and Shepherdesses,
and as the King and Queen pass'd by,
the eldest presented them with a Basket of Flowers,
and pronounc'd some Verses to them in the <i>German</i>
Language, expressing the Vows which all
the People made for the duration of their Prosperity.
Their Majesties, after stopping some time
before this House, return'd to the Palace.</p>

<p>Throughout all the King's Dominions there
were the like Demonstrations of Joy, and the
Coronation-day was celebrated every where like
a Sunday. The King and Queen spent the whole
Carnival at <i>Konigsberg</i>, where they receiv'd the
Count <i>de Tobianski</i> the Great Cup-bearer of <i>Poland</i>,
who came as Ambassador from the King
his Master, to congratulate their Majesties on
their Coronation. It must be observed in the
mean time, that the Republic of <i>Poland</i> never recogniz'd
the King of <i>Prussia</i>'s Royalty, tho' two
of its Kings, <i>viz.</i> the Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, and King
<i>Stanislaus</i> four years after recogniz'd him by their
Ambassadors.</p>

<p>The departure of the Court for <i>Berlin</i> was
fix'd for the eighth of <i>March</i>. As the King
had not yet made his entry at <i>Konigsberg</i>, the
Citizens entreated him to permit them to accompany
him as far as the limits of their Territory,
which was granted them. Then several triumphal
Arches were erected, all the Streets were
hung with Tapestry, and the King set out from
<i>Konigsberg</i> attended by all the City Companies.
His Majesty rode on horseback, supported by
two Equerries on foot. His Clothes were of
Crimson-Velvet lin'd with Ermin and embroider'd
with Gold, and the Buttons were of Diamonds.
He had on his Hat a Loop and a Hat-band<!--045.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of Diamonds. His Horse was most richly
accouter'd: The Bit, Stirrups, and all the Ornaments
of the Bridle, were of massy Gold; the
Housing of Crimson-Velvet, all cover'd with
Gold Embroidery and Diamonds. The Queen's
Coach was also of extraordinary Magnificence.
Her Majesty sate in it accompanied only by the
Duchess of <i>Courland</i>, who sate over-against
her.</p>

<p>In short, they went out of <i>Konigsberg</i> with all
the Pomp and Apparatus that us'd to attend Public
Entrys. When their Majesties were got a
quarter of a League out of the Town, they alighted
and went into their Travelling-Coaches,
and there they received the last Compliments
which were paid by the Echevins bare-headed
and kneeling. Then the King and Queen return'd
into the City through another Gate, and
staid in their Palace till next day that they set
out for <i>Berlin</i>.</p>

<p>The Court was oblig'd to go by the way of
<i>Dantzic</i>, because of the sudden Thaw of the
<i>Weissel</i>, which render'd it impassable. The Magistrates
of <i>Dantzic</i> immediately sent out Deputies
to their Majesties, to intreat them to permit
their City to make a public Entry for them; but
the King thank'd them, and was not willing they
should be at any expence. Nevertheless at the
Entrance of the Territory of <i>Dantzic</i> two Burgo-Masters,
four Counsellors, and the Syndic of the
Town, at the head of the Youth on horseback,
went and paid their Majesties a Compliment.
He that spoke was the chief Burgo-Master, who
pray'd their Majesties to suffer the City to defray
their Expences, while they stay'd in their Territory.
The King and Queen alighted at a House
erected on purpose for their Reception, which<!--046.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
was of Wood, and represented the Temple of
Glory. There their Majesties found a magnificent
Collation and a very fine Concert of Music.
In other Rooms several Tables were set up for
the Gentlemen of his Retinue. The King and
Queen having spent the Night there, pass'd thro'
<i>Dantzic</i> next day, and went over the <i>Weissel</i>,
which at that part of it was still frozen. Yet as
there was cause to apprehend that it was not
froze hard enough to be pass'd with safety, the
Magistrates, to prevent any Accident, had cover'd
the Ice with Straw, Beams and Planks; and
twenty-four young Men and as many Lasses,
dressed like Sailors in Jackets of Velvet and Sattin,
assisted the King and Queen in their passage;
during which, the Girls presented them with Fish,
Fruit, Sweet-Meats and Flowers, and the young
Sailors play'd to them on several Instruments of
Music. When their Majesties had passed the
River, they dismiss'd the Deputies of the City,
and made them each a Present of a Gold Chain
and Medal, on which were their Effigies. On
the seventeenth of <i>March</i> the King arriv'd at
<i>Potzdam</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, and the Queen at <i>Lutzelbourg</i>. The
King who had a Design to make a solemn Entry
at <i>Berlin</i>, stay'd at <i>Potzdam</i> till the sixth of <i>May</i>,
to give time for making the necessary Preparations
to receive him, and for the finishing one of
the Fronts of his Palace, which he wish'd might
be compleated by that day.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of <i>April</i> the King set
out from <i>Potzdam</i> for <i>Schonhausen</i>, where the
Queen met him some days after, and there their
Majesties prepared to make their Entry into
Berlin.<!--047.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>This Ceremony was perform'd with all the
Pomp and Magnificence possible. The City had
caus'd seven Triumphal Arches to be erected;
the Description of one of those Arches may suffice
to give an Idea of the Taste of our Court for
Entertainments of this kind. This Arch, which
was at the Bars entring the Suburb, seem'd to
have been built by Gardeners. It was one entire
Green-house with Pillars and Pilasters, adorn'd
with Flowers. <i>Pomona</i> and <i>Flora</i> were seen to
support the Pictures of the King and Queen.
The <i>Spring</i>, attended by the <i>Zephyrs</i>, presented
them with Fruits and Flowers, and a Row of
Orange-Trees and Laurels in gilded Boxes lin'd
the Way from that Arch to St. <i>George</i>'s Gate,
which has ever since that Day been call'd the
Royal Gate, because their Majesties enter'd thro'
it into the Town.</p>

<p>Next day after their Entry the Deputies of
the Provinces presented the King with Free
Gifts on his joyful Arrival, and the Margrave
<i>Philip</i> Grand Master of the Artillery, caus'd a
Fire-work to be play'd off, which represented the
King's Return to <i>Berlin</i>, by that of <i>Jason</i>, after
the Conquest of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>After some other Festivals of this nature, occasion'd
by the public Joy, the Court separated,
when the King set out for <i>Oranjebourg</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and the
Queen to <i>Lutzelbourg</i>. The Prince Royal staid
at <i>Berlin</i> to finish his Exercises. Care had been
taken to form a numerous Court for him, of all
young Gentlemen of his own Age, of whom this
young Prince had form'd two Companies, of
which himself commanded the first, and the
Duke of <i>Courland</i> the second. I was of this second<!--048.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Company, and we went sometimes to perform
our Military Exercises at <i>Lutzelbourg</i> before
the Queen, who lov'd to see the Prince her Son
display the first Fruits of his Military Genius.
We also acted some Comedies before her; for the
Princess aim'd to inspire the Prince her Son with
a delicate Taste, even in Pleasures.</p>

<p>'Twas at this time that a Storm arose at Court
against the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i> Great Chamberlain,
and lately declar'd Prime Minister, which
threaten'd his Ruin; but it spent itself upon
those only who had rais'd it. The principal Authors
of the Cabal were the Count <i>de Lottum</i>, M. &mdash;&mdash;,
and the Grand Marshal, who had been for a
long time the Great Chamberlain's sworn Enemy.
The Count <i>de Wesen</i>, my Father-in-law, was
pitch'd upon by these Gentlemen to raise the first
Prejudices in the King's Mind against this Minister.
I have had the Honor to acquaint you, <i>Madame</i>,
that the Countess <i>de Wartemberg</i> always wish'd
well to M. <i>de Wesen</i> of which the advantagious
Match she had procur'd for him was a very convincing
Proof. One would have thought therefore
after such great Service, that he ought in
Gratitude to have devoted himself entirely to the
Fortune of the Count her Husband. But my
Father-in-law puff'd up by the Choice which the
Count's Enemies had made of him, forgot his
Duty and his Interest, and accepted a Commission
for the undertaking of which he had in truth
all the necessary Temerity, but not that Judgment
nor that Favor, which was absolutely requisite
for conducting so ticklish an Affair.</p>

<p>The King had a real Love for M. <i>de Wartemberg</i>,
yet he sometimes made him feel his ill Humors.
The Prince seem'd one day to be so angry
with him, and spoke of him to my Father-in-law<!--049.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
with so much Resentment, that the latter
thought he had now a fair Opportunity to ruin
the Count. He said to the King, that the whole
Court was surpriz'd at his extraordinary Kindness
to a Minister who every day abus'd his Name in
the Oppression of the People, and in the Commission
of a thousand Acts of Injustice against his
faithful Servants; that his Rapines were excessive;
and that his Wife's Extravagance was so great,
that he could shew by the Accounts of the Comptrollers
of the Kitchen, that the Great Chamberlain's
Table cost more than his Majesty's. <i>I know
very well</i>, added M. <i>de Wesen, that if the Prime
Minister should hear of what I have now had the
Honor to say to your Majesty, I am undone; but if
I held my peace, I thought I should be wanting in
my Duty; and what I have asserted I am ready to
prove.</i></p>

<p>The King heard what he said very attentively,
and my Father-in-law was so vain as to think
he had made Impression enough upon him to
strike M. <i>de Wartemberg</i> quite out of his Favor;
but this shallow Statesman, my Father-in-law, did
not consider that a Prince who complains of his
Favorite is not always dispos'd to receive the ill
Impressions that others are ready to give of him.
Whether the King therefore thought after this
manner, or whether he was shock'd at the Ingratitude
of M. <i>de Wesen</i>, who ow'd his Fortune to
M. <i>de Wartemberg</i>, he told the Minister the
Conversation that had pass'd, but assur'd him that
he did not give Credit to the Report; and that if
he pleas'd he would take a Revenge on the Man
that had made it.</p>

<p>The crafty Minister affected at that time an
Air of Moderation, which cost him the less Pains
because he was an excellent Comedian. He said<!--050.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to the King that he thought himself sufficiently
reveng'd, by the little Heed his Majesty gave to
the scandalous Tales which his Enemies gave out
against him, and he desir'd his Majesty to pardon
those who had offer'd to abuse his Goodness, for
the sake of oppressing him. Thus did he for a
while conceal the keenest Resentment under the
Mask of the most forgiving Temper; being resolv'd
in his Heart to ruin those who had employ'd
M. <i>de Wesen</i>, tho' they were protected by
the Queen, but especially to make their Tool
feel all the Weight of his Vengeance.</p>

<p>A Journey which the King took to <i>Goltz</i>, one
of his Hunting-Seats, near the Fortress of <i>Custrin</i>,
gave him a good Opportunity for it. Being alone
with the King in the same Coach, he put
him so much out of conceit with M. <i>de Wesen</i>,
that when he arriv'd at <i>Goltz</i>, all that came to
wait on him, as he alighted out of the Coach,
perceiv'd he was in an ill Humor. Contrary to
his usual custom, he spoke to no body, only he
order'd my Father-in-law to give his Attendance.
When he had sat down, he scarce touch'd the
Bread, but he found fault with it, and complained
of it to M. <i>de Wesen</i>, as the Person who had
the Direction of what came to his Table. M.
<i>de Wesen</i> said to the King, That 'twas true the
Bread was not as it us'd to be, because the Carriage
of the Pantry broke down by the way, and
the Baker came too late to Town to provide more.
The King not well pleas'd with this Answer,
said, he was weary of being ill serv'd, and that
he expected every one shou'd do their Duty. At
the same time he threw his Napkin on the
Ground. M. <i>de Wesen</i> fetch'd another, and
offer'd it to the King, but he would not take it,
and order'd him to be gone that Moment out of<!--051.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
his Presence. Two Hours after, M. <i>de Wesen</i>
was arrested by an Exempt of the Life-Guards,
who conducted him in his Coach under a Guard
to <i>Custrin</i>, the Capital of the New Marquisate,
situate upon the <i>Oder</i>. There my Father-in-law
was kept as a State-Criminal, and the Minister
sent Orders to the Aulic Counsellor to go to my
Mother's House, and clap a Seal upon her
Husband's Effects. She was at that time in the
Country, and my Brother happen'd to be at
Church with our Governor, so that I was alone
in the House when those Gentlemen came to execute
their Order. After they had shew'd it to
me, they ask'd me which was my Father-in-law's
Apartment, that they might not be oblig'd to
put the Seal upon every thing. I made no
scruple to shew it to them, and as they withdrew
they left me a Writing which was an Order
to my Mother not to come to Court, nor to sollicite
her Husband's Liberty. I sent immediately
For my Governor, that he might go with this
disagreeable News to my Mother, whose Surprize
was as great as her Sorrow; for as she had
an entire Love for her Husband, so she knew
nothing of his Intrigues against the Minister, to
whom she thought he was all along devoted.
As the King's Order tied up her Hands, and
hinder'd her from coming to Court, I was charg'd
to do what I could there, to obtain my Father-in-law's
Liberty.</p>

<p>One day as the Queen made an Entertainment
at <i>Lutzelbourg</i> for the King, I presented a Petition
to him, in my Mother's Name, intreating
him to remove the Seal from her Effects, and
the Guard from her House; and that his Majesty
would be pleas'd to appoint Commissioners to
try her Husband; to the end, that if guilty, he<!--052.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
might be punish'd, or if innocent, that he might
be set at liberty. My Youth, and the Tears
which I shed at the Delivery of this Petition,
melted the King's Heart, who told me, That
he would do what my Mother desir'd, for her
sake only; that he sympathiz'd in her Affliction;
but that her Husband had so justly provok'd
him, that he could not avoid making him sensible
of his Indignation: That withal, he was
very glad to see me so good-natur'd, as to sollicite
in favor of a Man who he knew had not dealt
well either by my Brother or me, notwithstanding
the Injunction he laid upon him, when he
match'd him to my Mother. I made him answer,
that I had no reason to complain of my Father-in-law;
and that tho' I had, my Mother's extreme
Concern of Mind for what had happen'd, wou'd
be a sufficient Motive for me to sollicite his Liberty.
<i>I commend you</i> said the King, <i>for these
Principles. Go and tell your Mother that she shall
be made easy, and be assur'd that I will take care
of you</i>. Those were the very Expressions of the
King, who, when I stoop'd to embrace his
Knees, encourag'd me also by clapping his Hand
upon my Shoulder. As soon as he was gone, the
Queen sent for me into her Closet, to give her
an Account of this Conversation. I found her
resting on a Couch, attended by none but Madamoiselle
<i>de Pollnitz</i> my Cousin, who sat on
the Ground at her Feet. When the Queen had
enquir'd after my Mother's Health, she order'd me
to assure her of her Esteem and Friendship; and
when I had repeated to her what the King had
said to me, she made Answer, That she was very
glad the King was so well inclin'd to me. <i>Cultivate
his good Disposition</i>, said she, <i>make it your
Study to merit his Favor. As for me, I will do</i><!--053.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
<i>every thing in my power to preserve you in it;
and you may always be sure of my Protection.</i></p>

<p>So gracious a Reception both from the King
and Queen gave me great Hopes; and I return'd
to <i>Berlin</i>, not doubting but the Promises he had
made to me wou'd soon be perform'd; yet 'twas
not without tedious Sollicitations from my Mother's
Friends that she obtain'd her Husband's
Liberty, after seven Months Confinement, besides
paying a Fine for him of ten thousand
Crowns. The Revenge which the Minister took
upon those who had made my Father-in-law
their Agent, was not so much talk'd of; for he
contented himself with banishing them to their
respective Estates or Governments, and disposing
of their Offices among his most obsequious
Creatures. One of these was the Count
<i>de Witgenstein</i>, upon whom he confer'd the Office
of the Grand Marshal. He was a Person of a
good Family, but neither he nor his Ancestors
had ever done any Service to the State; and all
his Merit was an entire Devotion to the Prime
Minister, to whom he was more a Slave than a
Friend. As long as the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>
continu'd in Favor, he kept his ground at Court;
but the Fall of that Minister was attended with
his. The Disgrace of my Father-in-law did not
fail likewise to create a great deal of Trouble in
my Family. My Mother follow'd him to his Estate
in the Duchy of <i>Zell</i>, and I was sent with my
Brother under the Conduct of a Governor to
<i>Lunebourg</i>, there to finish my Studies.</p>

<p>All <i>Europe</i> was at this time in motion, and
had taken part in the Quarrel between the Houses
of <i>Austria</i> and <i>Bourbon</i>, on account of the Succession
to the Monarchy of <i>Spain</i>. <i>Philip</i> of
<i>Anjou</i> was already in possession of it, by virtue<!--054.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of <i>Charles</i> II's last Will and Testament; and in
pursuance of the Right he had to it by his
Grandmother <i>Mary Theresa</i> of <i>Austria</i>. The
Emperor founded his Claim upon the Renunciation
made by that Princess when she was married
to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. The greatest part of <i>Europe</i>,
which the exorbitant Power of <i>France</i> had
begun to alarm, sided with the Emperor, who
quitted his Rights in favor of the Archduke his
Son. Besides the common Interest which it
seem'd to be of all <i>Europe</i> to hinder two such
Monarchies as <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i> from being govern'd
by one Prince, several Potentates had
their particular Reasons, for laying hold of this
opportunity, to make war with <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>England</i> was alarm'd at the Proceeding
of <i>Lewis</i> XIV. who had just recogniz'd
the Son of <i>James</i> II. lately deceas'd at <i>St. Germains</i>,
for King of <i>England</i>, by the Name of
<i>James</i> III. in prejudice of King <i>William</i>, who had
been recogniz'd by the Treaty of <i>Ryswic</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Dutch</i> govern'd themselves by the Views
of King <i>William</i>, who was all along their Stadtholder:
And they could not forget the War in
1672, the Wounds of which were still bleeding.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Prussia</i>, besides his Interest in
common with the other Electors, to hinder
<i>France</i> from becoming too powerful, for fear lest
hereafter the said Court should saddle them with
whom it pleas'd for an Emperor, had Engagements
subsisting with the Court of <i>Vienna</i> and
the King of <i>England</i>. And in consequence of
those Engagements he furnish'd the Emperor
with 6000 Men, and gave Orders for a Levy in
his Dominions of 20,000 Men, which King <i>William</i>
had demanded of him, and which were<!--055.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
during the whole War in the Pay of the United
Provinces.</p>

<p><i>France</i> had no Allies but the Electors of <i>Bavaria</i>
and <i>Cologn</i>, who suffer'd themselves to be
prevail'd on by the Promises of <i>France</i>; the chief
of which was, That she would not make an end
of the War till she had caus'd the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i>
to be declar'd King of <i>Swabia.</i></p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Savoy</i> was proof against the Advantages
offered him by <i>France</i>: And notwithstanding
the Marriage of his two Daughters to
the Duke of <i>Burgundy</i> and the Duke of <i>Anjou</i>,
King of <i>Spain</i>, he was the most zealous Ally
against those two Crowns. He foresaw too very
plainly, that as long as those two Powers were
united, such was the Situation of his Dominions,
that they wou'd hem him in between them;
and therefore when the Duchess his Mother, who
was a thorow <i>French</i> Woman, ask'd him, What
would become of his Daughters, if he dethron'd
the King of <i>Spain</i>, and ruin'd <i>France</i>, he reply'd
to her, <i>And if I do not, what will become
of my Son?</i></p>

<p>These, <i>Madame</i>, were in general the various
Motions that affected <i>Europe</i> when King <i>William</i>
of <i>England</i> died: Nor did this Accident occasion
any Alteration; for the Princess <i>Anne Stuart</i>,
who succeeded him by the Name of Queen <i>Anne</i>,
pursued the same Views as her Predecessor, and
the War of the Allies against <i>France</i> was carried
on with the same Vigor.</p>

<p>By the Death of the King of <i>England</i>, who
was the last Prince of the <i>Orange</i> Branch, our
King was Heir to all his personal Estate; yet his
Right was contested by the Prince of <i>Nassau-Friesland</i>,
who, tho' not so nearly related as the
King, had the Advantage of Kindred by the<!--056.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Male Line, and had a Will of King <i>William</i> in
his Favor, which intitled him to his Succession.
As the States-General of the United Provinces
were the Executors of this Will, the King immediately
communicated his Pretensions to them,
as he did also to Queen <i>Anne</i>, by M. <i>de Spanheim</i>
his Ambassador at <i>London</i>. He founded his
Right upon a Will of <i>Frederic-Henry</i> Prince of
<i>Orange</i>, King <i>William</i>'s Grandfather, who had a
Son and three Daughters, the eldest of whom
married to the Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i> the King's
Father; the second to the Prince <i>de Simmeren</i>, a
younger Prince of the present reigning <i>Palatine</i>
Family, who dying without Issue, left his Right
of Succession to the Electorate, to the Branch of
<i>Neuburg</i>; and the third was married to the Prince
of <i>Anhalt-Dessau</i>.</p>

<p>The Will of <i>Frederic-Henry</i> call'd the Male
Descendants to his Succession; and on Failure of
them the three Princesses his Daughters; by virtue
of which, the King who descended from the
eldest, claimed to be the lawful Heir, notwithstanding
the Testament of King <i>William</i>, who
could not dispose of an Estate which was intail'd.
The King, for the better Manifestation of his
Rights, set out for the <i>Hague</i>, accompanied by
the Margrave <i>Albert</i>, his Brother, who left him
at <i>Wesel</i> in order to join the Army at <i>Keiserswaert</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>At <i>Wesel</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the King receiv'd Messieurs <i>de Lintelo</i>,
<i>Slingenlandt</i>, and <i>Tour</i>, Deputies from the
States-General, to whom he paid the same Honors
as to Sovereigns, and receiv'd them standing,
with only an Arm-Chair behind him. They<!--057.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
gave him an Account of the last Will and Testament
of King <i>William</i>, which they had caus'd
to be open'd in the Presence of M. <i>Schmettau</i> his
Ambassador, Mr. <i>Stanhope</i> the Envoy Extraordinary
of <i>England</i>, the Envoys of the Princesses
of <i>Anhalt</i> and <i>Nassau-Friesland</i>, the Envoy of
the Prince of <i>Nassau-Siegen</i>, the Commissioners
of the States appointed for that purpose, and the
Counsellors of the Domains of the late King <i>William</i>.
They added that they had found in this Will,
that the Prince of <i>Nassau</i>, hereditary Governor
of <i>Friesland</i>, was call'd to the Succession as universal
Heir, and they exhorted the King to own
him as such. But notwithstanding all this, he
enter'd his solemn Protest against the Will, and
then set out for the <i>Hague</i>.</p>

<p>The King at his arrival alighted at the Palace of
the Old Court, which was part of the Inheritance
of the King of <i>England</i>, and of which he had
already taken Possession, as well as of <i>Honslaerdyke</i>,
another Palace of the late King of <i>England</i>.
The <i>Dutch</i> wou'd fain have secur'd the Succession
to the Prince of <i>Nassau-Friesland</i>, but they
could not easily do this, without embroiling themselves
with the King. Therefore they chose to temporize,
and came to no Conclusion while the King
staid in <i>Holland</i>, during which they endeavor'd to
amuse him by procuring him all the Pleasures that
their Country afforded; but the Grand Affair of
the Succession to the King of <i>England</i> engross'd
all his Thoughts, and he went away very much
dissatisfy'd with the Conduct of the States-General
at this Juncture.</p>

<p>As soon as he return'd to <i>Berlin</i>, he sent for
my Brother and me from <i>Lunenburg</i>, for fear lest
my Mother, who was a <i>Lutheran</i>, should persuade
us to embrace that Religion. Next year<!--058.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
he establish'd an Academy, into which he gave
Orders for our Entrance. The View of this
Establishment was to educate the young Nobility
of the Court, in a manner suitable to their Extraction.
The King had the Nomination of those that
were to be admitted into this Academy, and
Care had been taken to furnish it with the best
Masters in all the Arts and Sciences. The Expence
of the Students there were very moderate,
the King having taken upon him to pay
the Extraordinaries. This illustrious School,
which was then call'd, <i>The Academy of Princes</i>,
has lost very much of its former Splendor.</p>

<p>I found the Court of <i>Berlin</i> in the same State
as when I left it. The Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>
was still in the highest Favor; and the Count
<i>de Barfous</i>, the only Man who had presum'd for
some time to make head against the Minister,
had at length been oblig'd to retire to his Estate;
but what made his Banishment from Court the
more tolerable to him, was a Pension which the
King allow'd him of 20,000 Crowns. His Post
of Velt-Marshal was given to M. <i>de Wartensleben</i>,
Lieutenant-General of the Emperor's Troops,
and General of those of the Duke of <i>Saxe Gotha</i>.
This was also a Creature of the Prime Minister;
yet he had Honor and Honesty enough to oppose
him on Occasions, where he thought the
Welfare of the State was concern'd. The Count <i>de
Lottum</i>, who had been involv'd in the Disgrace
of my Father-in-law, and whose Office of Grand
Marshal had been conferr'd on the Count <i>de Witgenstein</i>,
retain'd a certain Air of Favor in his Disgrace,
as did also the Count <i>de Barfous</i>. The King
had given him the Government of <i>Wesel</i>, to
which he retir'd; and as he could not avoid doing
justice to his Merit and Fidelity, he gave<!--059.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
him the Command of the Troops design'd for
the <i>Netherlands</i>. He was charg'd with the
Blockade of <i>Rhinberg</i>, a Place in the Electorate
of <i>Cologn</i>, which the <i>French</i> then possess'd, under
color of being that Elector's auxiliary Forces.
The Town surrendring in a little time, he undertook
the Blockade of <i>Guelders</i>, which made a
part of the <i>Spanish Netherlands</i>, and was yielded
to us by the Peace of <i>Utrecht</i>. The taking of
these two important Places in the midst of Winter,
and the Behaviour of the Count <i>de Lottum</i>,
who notwithstanding the Severity of the Season,
and the Treatment he had received from Court,
took all the Care possible for the Preservation of
the King's Troops, made him so much extoll'd
at Court, as was mortifying to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><i>France</i> endeavor'd to repair the Loss of these
two Places by seizing the Principality of <i>Orange</i>,
which we were not near enough to defend, and
he put the Prince of <i>Conti</i> in immediate Possession
of it, who had some claim to it through the
<i>Chalons</i> Family, of which he call'd himself Heir.
But he soon after yielded the said Principality
and his Pretensions, to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. who likewise
caus'd an Edict to be publish'd there, by which
it was put to the choice of all the Inhabitants to
turn Catholics, or to sell their Effects and retire
out of the Kingdom within the space of three
Months. The Generality of those who were
not willing to change their Religion, retir'd to
our Court, and among others, the Members of
the Parliament. The King reliev'd them as far
as he could, and caus'd Collections to be made
in all the Churches of his Dominions, the Money
of which was distributed to those who had the
most pressing Occasion for it.<!--060.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the Loss of <i>Orange</i>, the Margrave
<i>Albert</i> married the Princess of <i>Courland</i>. That
Prince in 1696, had succeeded the late Margrave
<i>Charles</i>, his Father, in the Grand Mastership<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of
the Order of St. <i>John</i>. This Order is the same
as that of <i>Maltha</i>, and is only separated from it
since <i>Luther</i>. The Commanderies, subject to the
Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i>, which became Protestant,
put themselves under the Elector's Protection,
and chose a Grand Master, or rather the Elector
chose one for them. The Choice has always
fallen upon a younger Prince of the Family, who
is not engag'd by it to any Vow, more than the
Knights, who are only obliged to prove their
Nobility, to which the Sovereign very often objects.</p>

<p>The Princess of <i>Courland</i> was the eldest of the
three Daughters that the Duke of <i>Courland</i> had
by his first Lady. He married to his second
Wife the King's Sister, and some time after he
died. The Duchess his Widow, who had been
oblig'd to abandon <i>Courland</i>, which the <i>Swedes</i>,
the <i>Poles</i> and the <i>Muscovites</i> equally harass'd,
came to <i>Konigsberg</i>, to be present at the Coronation
of the King her Brother, who gave her that
Protection she expected. Here it was, that the
Year before she had married the Margrave of
<i>Brandenburg Bareith</i>, the King's Cousin; and
when she went with her Husband into his Dominions,
she left the eldest of her Daughters-in-law
with the Queen, in hopes of her marrying
the Margrave <i>Albert</i>: And the Queen, who
was fond of this Princess, ordered it so, that
she obtain'd the King's Consent to the Marriage,
which was celebrated some time after at <i>Lutzelbourg</i>.<!--061.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>Much about this time we had a new Ceremony
in our Climates. This<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was the Erection
of a Statue which the King caus'd to be set up
in honor of his Father <i>Frederic-William</i> the
Great. 'Tis perfectly like that of <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
in the Square of <i>Vendôme</i> at <i>Paris</i>. The Pedestal
and Base are of white Marble. This Statue was
set up <i>July</i> 12, 1703; and the King in order
to do the more Honor to the Elector his Father,
caus'd the Ceremony to be perform'd with a magnificent
Apparatus, in presence of the whole Court,
and all the Benches of Justice.</p>

<p>The following Year 1704 was happy to the
Allies, by their Victories at <i>Donawert</i> and <i>Hochstet</i>.
The Troops that the King had sent into
<i>Franconia</i> and <i>Bavaria</i>, to the Emperor and
the City of <i>Nuremberg</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, which call'd for
Help against the <i>Bavarians</i>, contributed not a
little to the obtaining of those Victories. The
King received the News of it by an Express
that was dispatch'd to him from the Prince
of <i>Anhalt</i>, under whose Command those Succours
acted. This Express was follow'd some
Days after by a second, charg'd with a Letter
from Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i>, who therein gave
a sublime Encomium on the Valor of the <i>Prussian</i>
Troops. <i>I have been an Eye-witness, <span class="f">said he in his Letter</span>, particularly with regard to the
Infantry of the Right Wing, that all the Officers
as well as the common Soldiers fought with the most
intrepid Courage, and for several Hours check'd
the Efforts of the Enemy, who at length not being
able to resist their Bravery, and the continual Fire
which they made, were put into such a Confusion, that</i><!--062.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<i>they were oblig'd to fly with Precipitation, and
to abandon the Field of Battle to us.</i> The Prince
attributes this vigorous Action of the <i>Prussian</i>
Soldiers to the most exemplary Courage and
Valor of the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> their Commander.
<i>'Tis but Justice</i>, continu'd Prince Eugene, <i>to
give the Prince of <span class="f">Anhalt</span> the Praise he has so
well deserved. He hazarded his Person upon all
Occasions, and not intimidated by the Danger to
which he expos'd it, I always saw him at the
Head of his Troops, leading them on to Battle,
and encouraging them by his own Example; so
that it may be said to his Honor, that he contributed
the greatest Share to that Victory.</i> This was
a Panegyric the more pleasing to the Subject of
it, because it proceeded from the Mouth of a
Prince, who was too great a Master of Courage
to be mistaken.</p>

<p>After the Campaign was over, my Lord
<i>Marlborough</i> came to <i>Berlin</i>, where he receiv'd
all the Marks of Esteem from the King, which
he could possibly have desired. Every Point
that he negociated for the Operations of the Campaign
was granted him, and he went away from
Court highly satisfied. As soon as he was gone
the Prince Royal set out for <i>Hanover</i>, from
whence he went to <i>Holland</i>; and he intended to
pass over to <i>England</i>, but an Event which happen'd
to the Grief of him and the whole Court,
oblig'd him to return to <i>Berlin</i>.</p>

<p>This was the unexpected Death of the Queen,
on the 1st of <i>February</i> 1705, after a few
days Illness. This Princess us'd for some time
past to go to <i>Hanover</i>, to make a Visit to the
Electoress her Mother, of whom, as I have already
had the Honor to acquaint you, she was
extremely fond. The Day that she was to set<!--063.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
out for this Journey she found herself indispos'd,
but did not discover it, for fear lest the King
should not permit her to go. Her Illness continu'd
during the whole Journey, and When she
came to <i>Hanover</i>, what with the fatigue of receiving
Visits from the Ladies of the Court, and her
dancing at a Ball the same day, she grew much
worse. She came from the Ball with a Soreness
in her Throat, which prov'd so violent that the
Physicians and Surgeons soon despair'd of curing
her. The Queen, tho' in the Flower of her Age,
was not at all terrify'd when she saw Death approaching
her. She wrote a very tender Letter
to the King, in which she thanked him for
the Love he had always manifested to her, and
recommended her Domestics to him. Her Brother
the Duke <i>Ernest Augustus</i> was so deeply
concern'd to see her in such a condition, that she
did what she could to comfort him: <i>There is nothing
so natural</i>, said she to him, <i>as Death; 'tis
unavoidable, and tho' I am young enough to hope
to live a few Years longer, yet I am not loth to
die</i>.</p>

<p>M. <i>de la Bergerie</i> the Minister of the <i>French</i>
Church, who assisted her in her last Moments,
was so surpriz'd at her courage and calmness,
that he was more attentive to hear her than to
exhort her. <i>I have</i>, said she, <i>for twenty Years
seriously study'd my Religion, and have read the
Books that treat of it with too much application
to be in any doubt as to my Principles. You cannot
mention any thing to me but what I have read,
and what you can say to me will certainly add nothing
to my Opinion.</i> Then turning towards my
Cousin, who was on the other side of her Bed,
<i>Alas!</i> said she, <i>what a deal of needless Ceremony
is now going to be us'd about this Body of mine</i>! At<!--064.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the same time almost, she stretch'd out her Hand
to Duke <i>Ernest</i> her Brother, and said to him,
<i>Dear Brother, I am choak'd</i>; and that Moment
she expir'd.</p>

<p>A Courier was immediately dispatch'd to the
Prince Royal, who was at the <i>Hague</i>, and M. <i>de
Bulau</i> the Steward of the Queen's Houshold carried
the News to the King, who was so surpriz'd
at it, that he fainted away several times. When
he came to himself he shew'd marks of the sincerest
Affliction, and seem'd fully sensible what a
loss he had sustain'd. Indeed this Princess truly
deserv'd his Lamentation, as well as the Sorrow
of the whole State; and I for my part with my
whole Family lost a solid and sincere Protectress.</p>

<p>The King's Grief was such, that it had no Interval,
but in his application to pay those Honours
to the Queen, that were due to her Rank. He
was willing to signalize it by the magnificence of
a Funeral Pomp, and for this purpose he himself
issued the necessary Orders. The Elector of <i>Hanover</i>
(afterwards King of <i>England</i>) omitted nothing
on his part to shew his Sorrow for the loss
of so dear a Sister. Her Body was laid for several
days upon a sumptuous Bed of State; her
Ladies and the Officers of her Houshold who
had waited on her to <i>Hanover</i> encompass'd it,
and the Elector's Guards and Officers stay'd with
the Queen's Corpse, and pay'd the same Attendance
as if she had been living. When every
thing was ready to carry the Corpse to <i>Berlin</i>,
the Elector caus'd it to be convey'd by all his
Guards even to the Frontiers of the Duchy of
<i>Zell</i>, where it was receiv'd by M. <i>de Bulau</i> the
Grand Marshal of the Court, who conducted it
to the Territories of <i>Brandenburg</i>; and there it<!--065.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
was receiv'd by the Count <i>de Witgenstein</i>, who
accompany'd it as far as <i>Berlin</i>, where I remember
it arriv'd about ten o'clock at Night in a terrible
Shower of Rain. The King accompany'd
by the Prince Royal and the Margraves in long
Mourning-Cloaks and by the Ladies of the
Court in deep Mourning-Veils, receiv'd the
Queen's Corpse at its being taken out of the Funeral-Chariot,
and accompany'd it into the Old
Chapel where a magnificent Cataphalque was erected
for depositing it.</p>

<p>It represented a Temple of an Oval Form,
whose Roof was supported by Pillars of the <i>Corinthian</i>
Order, between each of which were
plac'd Statues that represented the Queen's Vertues.
In the middle of the Cataphalque just in
the Upright there was a Glory, in which there
was the Queen's Cypher form'd by Stars. All the
Statues, that were silver'd, added to the Lustres,
Branches and Chandeliers, made a noble Contrast
with the Black that cover'd the Walls and the
Roof. There the Queen's Corpse was repos'd
till every thing was ready for her Interment. I
will not here enter into the detail of that Ceremony,
which was one of the most magnificent.
What I observ'd extraordinary in it was, that
'twas the King's pleasure that the Parliament of
<i>Orange</i>, of which the greatest part were Refugees
at Court, should appear there in their Scarlet Robes.</p>

<p>The Queen's Death occasion'd no alteration in
Affairs; for she meddled with the Government
very little, and left all the care of it to the King
and his Ministers: But in matters of Pleasure
she was not so unconcern'd; and she understood
them so well, that she was soon miss'd. The
Courtiers sustain'd a Lose that was irreparable;
for this Princess, who knew every body, was perfectly<!--066.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
acquainted with every one's Birth and Merit,
and took a delight to distinguish them. Being
lofty, but at the same time polite, she knew better
than any body in the World what it was to keep
a Court; and being virtuous without meanness,
she could tell (which is no easy matter) how to
prescribe just Bounds to that Air of Gallantry,
which alone is capable of rendering a Court agreeable,
and preserving Politeness in it.</p>

<p>The only Princess capable of supplying her
place was the Margravine <i>Philippa</i>, who then
held the first Rank at Court. She was the
Daughter of the Prince of <i>Anhalt-Dessau</i>, and
of the Princess of <i>Orange</i>. She was good-natur'd
and merry, and fond of Pleasures, but understood
the delicacy of them. She might sometimes
have made us forget the loss of the Queen, if the
austere and perhaps jealous Humor of her Husband
the Margrave <i>Philip</i> had not inclin'd that
Prince to prefer his Residence at his House at
<i>Schwedt</i> to the Court.</p>

<p>Soon after the Queen, died the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>;
which was an Event that affected us not so
much as the other, but concern'd the rest of <i>Europe</i>
more. It was presently imagin'd that the
Views to the Succession of <i>Spain</i> would have suffer'd
some alteration by this Prince's Death; for
the Emperor <i>Joseph</i> who succeeded his Father
having no Son, the Archduke his Brother who
disputed the Crown of <i>Spain</i> with the Duke of
<i>Anjou</i> was his only Heir, and might one day or
other by his Death become Master of the Empire,
and of the Dominions of the House of
<i>Austria</i>. Therefore they who dreaded to see the
two Crowns united upon one Head, had as much
and more reason to fear the Archduke's making
himself Master of <i>Spain</i>; the Duke of <i>Anjou</i><!--067.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
who was already in possession of that Crown, being
at that time very remote from that of <i>France</i>,
by reason of the great number of Princes that
had a prior Right to his. Nevertheless the
Powers of <i>Europe</i> were not mov'd by these Reflections,
and the War was continu'd on the side
of the Allies with considerable Success.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Sweden</i> might, if he had pleased,
have stopp'd the progress of it, and immortaliz'd
his Name by rendring himself the Arbiter of a
Quarrel, which divided <i>Europe</i>; for the Prosperity
of his Arms had render'd him the Terror of
all the Powers in the North. He had in the Year
1704 depriv'd the Elector of <i>Saxony</i> of the Crown
of <i>Poland</i>, by causing King <i>Stanislaus Leszinski</i>
the Palatine of <i>Posen</i>, to be proclaim'd King of
<i>Poland</i>; and he was already in the middle of
<i>Saxony</i> where he committed universal Ravage,
and when he might have turn'd the Balance
which way he pleas'd, the wrong Advice of his
Favorite, corrupted by my Lord <i>Marlborough</i>,
was the cause of the Misfortunes into which that
Prince was afterwards precipitated.</p>

<p>Our Court has had a sufficient share in these
different Events; but perhaps, <i>Madame</i>, 'tis so
little known at your's as to deserve your Curiosity:
but I will only tell you of what I think
most important.</p>

<p>The <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Poles</i> had scarce laid down
their Arms when the Differences between the
King of <i>Denmark</i> and the Duke of <i>Holstein</i> gave
them a fresh occasion to take them up again. In
the Conferences that were begun at <i>Pinneberg</i> in
1696, there were hopes that those Princes would
soon be reconcil'd; but they only patch'd up a
Peace which could not last long, because of the
Umbrage the King of <i>Denmark</i> took at the Duke<!--068.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of <i>Holstein</i>'s strict Alliance with <i>Sweden</i>; and
they quarrel'd again about the limits of their
Dominions. The <i>Danes</i> were the Aggressors,
and they demanded a reinforcement of four
thousand Men of the King of <i>Poland</i>. This
Prince, who naturally took part with those that
declar'd against <i>Sweden</i>, was pleas'd well enough
with the <i>Danes</i> Demand, and as there was an
absolute necessity of passing those Troops over
the Lands of the King, (at that time Elector) he
sent the Count <i>de Flemming</i>, now his Prime Minister,
to our Court, in order to sollicite their passage.
Of a great many Arguments that were alledg'd
against it, the most specious were, 'That
the Mediators being still actually employ'd in
procuring a just and equitable Accommodation,
it was the duty of a Mediator to hinder
the Rupture, rather than contribute to it by
favoring this passage: That the Court of <i>Prussia</i>
was Guarantee for the King of <i>Sweden</i> and
the Duke of <i>Holstein</i>, that neither of those two
Princes should begin the War against the King
of <i>Denmark</i>; and that consequently as War was
not declar'd against that Prince, his <i>Danish</i> Majesty
had no need of Foreign Assistance; and
that finally by giving passage to those Troops
the Duke of <i>Holstein</i> would have just reason to
accuse the Mediation of Partiality.' Nevertheless,
after all these fine reasons, the four thousand
Men had their Passage, either from surprise
or the connivance of the Court. The King of
<i>Poland</i> on his part, in order to make a considerable
Diversion in favor of the King of <i>Denmark</i>,
brought Troops from <i>Livonia</i> and besieg'd <i>Riga</i>,
which then belong'd to the <i>Swedes</i>. This Conduct
of the King of <i>Poland</i>, was, Madame, as
the fatal Signal and the <i>Primum Mobile</i> of that<!--069.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
tragical War, which tho' so glorious for the King
of <i>Sweden</i> in the beginning, ended in the ruin
not only of his Kingdom, but also of <i>Poland</i> and
<i>Saxony</i>. And the greatest Gainer by it was the
<i>Czar</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Danes</i> while they waited for the Succours
they had demanded from <i>Poland</i>, besieg'd the
Fortress of <i>Tonningen</i> in the Duchy of <i>Sleswic</i>.
The King of <i>Sweden</i> and the Duke of <i>Holstein</i>,
before they oppos'd this Enterprize, preferr'd
their Complaints to the Dyet of the Empire,
and then prepar'd for driving the <i>Danes</i> out of
the Country. The Elector of <i>Hanover</i> and the
Duke of <i>Zell</i> join'd those two Princes, and the
latter marching to the Relief of <i>Tonningen</i> had
the Honor of obliging the Besiegers to abandon
it, upon the report only of his Approach. This
Prince therefore having nothing to do towards
<i>Tonningen</i>, went with his Troops and rejoin'd
the Elector of <i>Hanover</i>. They met the four
thousand Men whom the King of <i>Poland</i> was
sending to the Assistance of the <i>Danes</i>, but only
took their Baggage and Arms, and then left them
at liberty to return home.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Sweden</i>, on his part, push'd on
the War against the <i>Poles</i>. That great Prince
whom extraordinary Undertakings never startled,
having already ravag'd a part of <i>Poland</i>, design'd
a bold stroke, which was no less than dethroning
the lawful King of that Country, and setting
up another in his room. He had cast his
eyes upon <i>James</i> of <i>Poland</i>, Son of King <i>John
Sobieski</i>; but the King of <i>Poland</i> parry'd this
blow, by causing the Prince <i>James</i> and his
Brother Prince <i>Constantine</i>, to be carried away
from an Estate of theirs near <i>Breslau</i> to <i>Saxony</i>,
where they were strictly guarded like<!--070.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Prisoners at the Castle of <i>Leipsic</i>. The Confinement
of these Princes did indeed hinder either
of them from being elected King; but the King
of <i>Sweden</i> still persisted in his design of dethroning
the King of <i>Poland</i>, on purpose to be reveng'd
of that Prince for being so rash as to be
the first that declar'd War against him. He
caused the Election to fall upon <i>Stanislaus Leczinski</i>
the Palatine of <i>Posen</i>. The Bishop of
<i>Posen</i> officiated as Cardinal Primate in this Ceremony,
and proclaim'd the new King. The King
of <i>Sweden</i> wrote to all the Princes with whom
he was at peace, to acquaint them of this new
Election, and to exhort them to recognize it.
The Letter he wrote to our King had no Influence
over him; for he made answer, that he
had recogniz'd one King of <i>Poland</i> already, and
that as long as he liv'd he would acknowledge
no other. He wrote at the same time to the
King of <i>Poland</i>, to demand the Liberty of
the two Princes. The Emperor, to whom
the eldest had the Honour of being Brother-in-law,
seconded the King's Demand; but the
Solicitations of both had no consequence, and
the Princes were not releas'd till a long time
after.</p>

<p>The following Year the King undertook to
procure a Peace between the Kings of <i>Sweden</i> and
<i>Poland</i>; but as the view of such Reconciliation
was to re-establish the Prince of <i>Saxony</i> upon the
Throne of <i>Poland</i>, the King of <i>Sweden</i> would
hearken to no Proposal of Peace, unless the dethron'd
King would solemnly renounce the
Crown. Mean time his <i>Swedish</i> Majesty, in order
to mollify his Refusal of the King's Mediation,
sent an Ambassador-Extraordinary to him
to recognize him as King of <i>Prussia</i>. This Ambassador<!--071.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
was the first that ever made a public
Entry at <i>Berlin</i>, and 'twas one of the most
splendid that cou'd be, tho' all the Equipages
were in Mourning by reason of the Death of the
Queen.</p>

<p>Thus did this crafty King, by amusing those
he had a mind to keep fair with, always push at
his own ends. He continu'd to ravage <i>Poland</i>,
and drove the King from thence into his Electorate
of <i>Saxony</i>. There the <i>Swedish</i> Soldiers took
up their Winter-Quarters, and committed such
Outrages as one would not have expected from
a Nation so fruitful in Heroes. The <i>Swedish</i>
Prince signaliz'd his Entrance into <i>Saxony</i> by a
glorious Action, which was procuring the Liberty
of the two <i>Polish</i> Princes, who had for two Years
been detain'd Prisoners with very great Severity
and as little Reason. He afterwards march'd
through all <i>Saxony</i> with the haughtiness of a
Conqueror who comes to prescribe Laws to those
whom he has reduc'd to his Obedience. As for
King <i>Stanislaus</i> whom he had caus'd to be
crown'd King of <i>Poland</i> at <i>Warsaw</i>, he led him
about, with him as it were in Triumph. As this new
King advanc'd towards the Territories of the Electorate
of <i>Brandenburg</i>, to meet the Queen his Wife
who was coming from <i>Stetin</i>, our Court caus'd all
the Honours to be paid to him that were due to
the Royal Dignity, without recognizing him all
the while for King. This Complaisance of our
Court won the King of <i>Sweden</i>'s Heart. Mean
time the Neighbourhood of this great Monarch,
who, where-ever he march'd, carried Fire and
Sword with him, gave vast uneasiness, and the
Joy was as great when he manifested a Design
to turn his Arms against the <i>Muscovites</i>, which
he was put upon to do by the <i>English</i>. They<!--072.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
had for some time past suspected him to be supported
under-hand by <i>France</i>, and they thought the
best way to embroil him with that Crown was to
engage him in a War with the <i>Czar</i>. The Person
commission'd to negociate this Affair was my
Lord <i>Marlborough</i>, who went to the King of
<i>Sweden</i>, and soon put his Negociation in a hopeful
way to succeed. He found about the King
a Minister so sordid, that he was not proof against
an Offer of three hundred thousand
Crowns, to betray his Master into a War which
could not but be fatal to him; whereas, if he
had pleas'd, he might have acquir'd immortal
Glory in the midst of <i>Saxony</i>, by rendring himself
the Umpire of two of the most potent Families
in <i>Europe</i>, then contending for the Crown of
<i>Spain</i>. This Minister knowing his Master's ambitious
Temper, propos'd no less to him than dethroning
the <i>Czar</i>. The young Monarch full
of Zeal and Courage did not imagine how impossible
it was to dethrone a Prince who was retir'd
behind Provinces quite deserted, and where
the Snow lay so deep that 'twas difficult to distinguish
whether they walk'd upon Land or Rivers.
He march'd out of the Electorate of
<i>Saxony</i> at the Head of his Troops about the end
of the Year 1707. Never had People juster
Reasons for giving public Marks of their Joy,
than the <i>Saxons</i> had to see the <i>Swedish</i> Monarch
turn his Back to them. His Troops had committed
excessive Outrages in the Electorate; all
the flat Country of <i>Saxony</i> was intirely ruin'd,
and, except some great Towns such as <i>Leipsic</i>,
where they generously enough spent part of the
Money they had extorted from the poor <i>Saxon</i>
Peasant, there was not a Hamlet but was laid
waste to such a degree, that there were no hopes<!--073.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of its being restor'd to its original Condition one
while.</p>

<p>Yet if the Misfortunes of an Enemy can in any
measure compensate the Losses he has occasion'd,
the <i>Saxons</i> had all the reason in the World to be
pleas'd in the Sequel. The <i>Swedish</i> Troops gave
way every where to the <i>Muscovites</i>, who flush'd
with former Victories, beat them to nothing.</p>

<p>The greatest Loss the King of <i>Sweden</i> sustain'd
was near <i>Pultowa</i>. This Prince, who was more
ambitious than prudent, being got too far into
<i>Muscovy</i>, did not perceive his error till it was
too late to retrieve it. The <i>Czar</i> had the Precaution,
as he retir'd a little before into his own
Dominions, to burn above forty Leagues of
Country thro' which the King of <i>Sweden</i> was to
pass to him; so that this Prince soon found himself
in a very sad situation, not being able to stay
in a place where there was no manner of Provision,
and forc'd to engage with an Army well
intrench'd and far superior to his own. But
there was no avoiding it, and a Battle was fought
the 8th of <i>July</i> 1709, when the <i>Swedes</i> were
all either cut in pieces or taken Prisoners by the
<i>Muscovites</i>. The King who was oblig'd by a
Wound in his Heel to be carry'd in a Litter had
like to have been kill'd, for one Cannon-Ball
kill'd one of his Horses, and a second demolish'd
his Litter. The whole Army was in pain for
the King's Life; but the Officers who were near
his Person snatch'd him out of danger, and advis'd
him to provide for his safety. This Prince
was very loth to comply with such a resolution,
but finding himself oblig'd to yield to Force, retir'd
to <i>Bender</i>, a little Town at the entrance of
<i>Moldavia</i>, which belongs to the <i>Turkish</i> Empire.
The King of <i>Sweden</i> was no sooner safe,<!--074.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
but the Remains of his Army with their Generals
at their head submitted to the Conqueror. This,
Madame, was the Success of the Battle of <i>Pultowa</i>;
a Battle glorious to the <i>Muscovites</i>, but
so fatal to the King of <i>Sweden</i> that he could never
recover it: For after this Defeat this young
Hero was always expos'd to the most cruel Reverses
of that very Fortune, which in his early
Years seem'd to delight in heaping Favors on
him.</p>

<p>Mean time the two Families in competition
for the Crown of <i>Spain</i> had not yet sheath'd
their Swords. The King of <i>Sweden</i> was even
yet in the Electorate of <i>Saxony</i> when the <i>French</i>
lost the famous Battle of <i>Ramellies</i>, which procur'd
the Allies the greatest part of the <i>Spanish
Netherlands</i>. The Troops in <i>Italy</i> also distinguish'd
themselves, and particularly the <i>Prussians</i>,
who had so great a share in the raising of the
Siege of <i>Turin</i>, that the Duke of <i>Savoy</i> wrote a
Letter to the King, in which he extolled the Valor
of the <i>Prussian</i> Generals and Soldiers. "Yesterday,
<i>said he</i>, the Enemy's Army was intirely
put to the rout in their own Lines before this
place (<i>Turin</i>), in which your Majesty's Troops
had the greatest share, and I can never enough
commend their Bravery, nor the notable Valour
of the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i>, who led them
on, <i>&amp;c.</i>" This Letter was dated the 8th of
<i>September</i>, 1706.</p>

<p>The Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> too sent an Express
with the same News to the King, and gave a
great Character of the Troops under his Command.
"As your Majesty's Troops, <i>said he,
in his Letter</i>, were the first that enter'd the
Enemy's Trenches, so they have suffer'd very
much, and especially the Grenadiers. I may<!--075.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
say that your Majesty's Forces have behav'd
so well, that they are intitled to universal Praise
and Admiration, <i>&amp;c</i>." Then he enter'd into
the Detail of the Losses sustain'd by the <i>French</i>,
which were indeed very considerable. 'Twas
upon this occasion that the Marshal <i>de Marsin</i>
was wounded and taken Prisoner, and besides
forty-five Pieces of heavy Cannon and one hundred
and forty lesser that were taken from them,
they lost a great Convoy of two thousand Mules
and one thousand Horses, which was guarded
by the Regiment of Dragoons of <i>Chatillon</i>.</p>

<p>The raising of this Siege, and the Reputation
the <i>Prussian</i> Troops thereby acquired was very
acceptable News to the King, and while the
Court was rejoicing for this, there arriv'd other
Advices which gave them no less pleasure; and
that was the raising of the Siege of <i>Barcelona</i>.
This City had been besieg'd for some time by
the Marshal <i>de Tesse</i>; but King <i>Charles</i> who
defended it made so stout a Resistance and such
destructive Sallies upon the <i>French</i> Army, that
the latter was oblig'd to retire. The King was
inform'd of it by an Express from King
<i>Charles</i>.</p>

<p>So many Successes one after another rais'd
the hopes of the Allies prodigiously. The Terror
the <i>French</i> Arms had for a long time impress'd
upon their Minds soon wore off, and
nothing was heard every where but shouts of
Joy, to see so haughty a Nation at last humbled.
Our Court was more rejoic'd than any other at
this great News, and every one envy'd the Fortune
of the <i>Prussian</i> Soldiers, when they saw that
the Duke of <i>Savoy</i> and the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i>
themselves, gave them the highest Encomia.<!--076.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>At this happy Juncture was celebrated the
Marriage of the Prince Royal, which had been
concluded at <i>Hanover</i>, a Journey the King made
thither with the Prince his Son. This young Prince
had for a long time such a veneration for the
Princess the Elector's Daughter, as 'twas possible
for the most accomplish'd Merit to inspire him
with, and of all the Princesses in the World
she was like to be the most acceptable to her
Subjects; she represented to us the Idea of the
late Queen, and as she was her Niece and design'd
to succeed to her Dominions, she seem'd also to
have inherited all the great Qualities that made
the former ador'd at our Court. The Electoral
Prince of <i>Hanover</i> married her at <i>Hanover</i> by
Proxy, in presence of the Count <i>de Finck</i> the
King's Ambassador. The Princess set out from
thence some days after with a Train becoming
her present and her future Dignity. The Elector
her Father had given her the most magnificent
Suits of Apparel and Jewels that could
be got for Money, and they were purchas'd at
<i>Paris</i> by a Man sent on purpose. The Duchess
of <i>Orleans</i> was desirous to chuse and give Directions
for the Clothes, and she afterwards
shewed them to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. who thought them
so rich that he said it were to be wish'd for the
sake of the Mercers of <i>Paris</i>, that there were
more Princesses that could afford to make such
Purchases.</p>

<p>'Twas <i>Novemb. 27, 1706</i>, that this Princess
made her public Entry at <i>Berlin</i>. The King
met her about half a League out of Town.
As soon as her Royal Highness perceiv'd the
King's Coach she alighted, as the King did
also from his and went to meet her. After
having embraced the Princess he presented the<!--077.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Prince Royal to her, together with his Brothers
and the two Princesses. Then the King
took Coach again, where the Princess plac'd herself
on the King's left hand; and the two Margraves
sate over-against them; the Prince-Royal
and the King's three Brothers being mounted
on Horseback. The Entry was one of the
most magnificent that was ever seen. All the
Troops then at <i>Berlin</i> were under Arms, as
well as all the City-Militia, and drawn up in a
Line from the Out-parts of the Town quite
to the Palace. The next day after the Princess's
Arrival, there was a sumptuous Feast, at
which the Prince Royal and the Princess had
Arm-Chairs, but for that day only; for the
next day their Royal Hignesses sate in upright
Chairs at the two ends of the Table.</p>

<p>Our Court was then as splendid as in the
time of the late Queen. There was a continual
Round of Pleasures, and every day was remarkable
for Feasts, Balls, Comedies, <i>&amp;c.</i> These
Rejoicings had lasted a good while, when all on
a sudden we had a most terrible Alarm. The King
fell dangerously ill, and his Physicians began
to despair of his Recovery. But God, who always
considers the Wants of his People, did us
the favor to restore him to us for a while longer.
Upon his Recovery he receiv'd the Compliments
of the whole Court, and the Congratulations of
the Princes his Allies, who acknowledg'd as well
as his Subjects how necessary his Preservation
was to the Common Cause.</p>

<p>Not long after the King's Recovery, I saw
the young Count <i>de Metternich</i> arrive at <i>Berlin</i>,
who came to bring the King Advice, That the
<i>Swissers</i> had at length recogniz'd his Majesty for
Sovereign Prince of <i>Neufchâtel</i>, preferably to the<!--078.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
other Princes his Competitors. The Count <i>de
Metternich</i>, who was the King's Ambassador in
<i>Swisserland</i>, had the good Fortune to carry this
Point, notwithstanding the Menaces of <i>France</i>,
who asserted the Interests of several of her Subjects,
at the Head of whom was the Prince of
<i>Conti</i>. Madame <i>de Nemours</i>, the Sovereign of
<i>Neufchâtel</i>, was no sooner dead, but each of the
Claimants put in their Plea of Right to this Sovereignty.
As soon as the News of her Death
was confirm'd, the King sent Orders to M. <i>de
Metternich</i>, his Ambassador-Extraordinary and his
Plenipotentiary in <i>Swisserland</i>, to repair to <i>Neufchâtel</i>
and take care of his Interests. He went
thither accordingly on the 30th of <i>June</i>, and
caus'd a Memorial to be distributed at his Arrival,
containing the King's Right to the said
Principality. The <i>French</i> Competitors on their
part distributed another, to establish their own
Rights, and invalidate the Pretensions of the
King. There happen'd to be Disputes between
the Prince of <i>Conti</i> and the <i>Prussian</i> Ambassador
about Precedency. M. <i>de Puisieux</i> the Ambassador
of <i>France</i>, as it was his Duty to do, maintain'd
the Interests of the Prince of <i>Conti</i>, and
presented to the Council of <i>Neufchâtel</i> a Memorial
so haughty and menacing, as if it had come
from victorious <i>France</i> in the Time when she
was flush'd with Conquests. He said in this
Memorial, "That the King his Master cannot
look with Indifference upon the Conduct at
<i>Neufchâtel</i>, in presuming to be so disrespectful
to the Princes of his Family; that it wou'd
be the wisest way for the Gentlemen of the
Council speedily to take Measures to prevent
this Pretension of the <i>Prussian</i> Minister from
being carried any further, a Pretension, <i>said</i><!--079.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
<i>he</i>, which has no Foundation, but in Malice
or Ignorance; because even tho' the new Title,
which the Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i> has assum'd
for some years, were universally recogniz'd,
yet this very Pretension of his Ambassador's
would be always chimerical." Here M.
<i>de Puisieux</i> gave them Warning, "That if they
did not soon alter their Conduct, the King of
<i>France</i> wou'd take Measures very opposite to
the pacific and kind Sentiments which he had
entertain'd since the Affair of <i>Neufchâtel</i> was
first in agitation." Such, <i>Madame</i>, was the
Strain in which the <i>French</i> Minister talk'd. This
Memorial was follow'd by several others, which
went to the very bottom of the Affair; and M.
<i>de Puisieux</i>, in order to engage the Council of
<i>Neufchâtel</i> to favour the <i>French</i> Claimants, still
continued to talk in such a high Stile, as prejudiced
every body against the Side that he espous'd.
You may judge of this Ambassador's manner of
Negociation, by the last Memorial which he
presented towards the close of <i>October</i> 1707.
After having establish'd the Right of the <i>French</i>
Competitors with continual Invectives, he concluded
thus; <i>If it happens contrary to my Expectation,
that your Answer is not conformable to
what I demand,&mdash;I have fresh Orders from his
Majesty to assure you, that nothing will be capable
to hinder the Effects of his Indignation, or to
screen you from that just Vengeance which he proposes
to take.</i> Then, as if he affected to speak in
a softer Strain, he said to them with an Air of
Protection, "That he hop'd while he staid at
<i>Neufchâtel</i>, to find favourable Inclinations for
the entire Performance of what he wish'd for."
<i>'Tis the only thing you can do
(<span class="f">these are the last Words of his Memorial</span>)
to merit the Continuance</i><!--080.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
<i>of his Majesty's Good-will. I wish for my
own part, that you wou'd furnish me with Opportunities
to help maintain you in it.</i> But all
these Menaces of the <i>French</i> Ambassador came
to nothing, and only procur'd him sharp Answers
from the Ambassadors of <i>Prussia</i>, <i>England</i>,
and <i>Holland</i>; for things went on in the same
Course in the Council of <i>Neufchâtel</i>, and the
whole Affair was determined to the Satisfaction
of the King, who was proclaim'd Sovereign
thereof on the 3d of <i>November</i> 1707.</p>

<p>As soon as the King had been recogniz'd in
that Sovereignty, the Count <i>de Metternich</i> sent
his Son to his Majesty with the Sentence of the
three Estates, declaring the King lawful Heir
of the said Principality, by <i>Louisa</i> of <i>Nassau</i> his
Mother, the eldest Daughter of Prince <i>Frederic-Henry</i>,
Son of <i>William</i> of <i>Nassau</i> call'd the <i>Belgic</i>,
to whom there had been a Transfer of the Rights
of the House of <i>Chalons</i>, to which the Sovereignty
and Domaine of <i>Neufchâtel</i> originally
belong'd.</p>

<p>The News of the Acquisition of this Sovereignty
cou'd not but be very acceptable to the King,
who gave the young Count a most favorable
Reception, made him noble Presents, and amongst
others, gave him the Key of Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Not many days after, <i>viz. Nov</i>. 23, 1707,
the Court had a fresh Subject of Joy, by the
Princess Royal's safe Delivery of a Prince, whom
the King immediately declared Prince of <i>Orange</i>,
and made him at the same time a Knight of the
Grand Order. His Majesty after this dispatch'd
Couriers to his Ambassadors at the Courts of the
Princes his Allies to acquaint them of the Birth
of his Grandson. M. <i>de Spanheim</i> the Ambassador
in <i>England</i> received Orders to desire the<!--081.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Queen to be God-mother to the young Prince;,
and M. <i>de Schmettau</i> Ambassador in <i>Holland</i>,
and M. <i>de Metternich</i> Ambassador in <i>Swisserland</i>,
were charged to invite the States with
whom they resided to be God-fathers. Besides
these Powers, the King and the Elector of <i>Hanover</i>
were God-fathers, and the Electoress of
<i>Hanover</i> was God-mother. The Baptism was
performed with great Magnificence on the 3d of
<i>December</i> in the Church of the <i>Dome</i>. The Joy
at Court for the Birth of this Prince was of no
long Duration; for in a few Months after, he died:
but the Sorrow for the Loss of him was alleviated,
by the Hopes that the Prince Royal had Youth
and Health enough to give us soon more Heirs.
The Incident that was most alarming, was the
weakly Condition of the King, who recover'd
but slowly from his Grand Ailment; so that his
Physicians advis'd him to make use of the Waters
of<i>Carlsbadt</i> in <i>Bohemia</i>; and at the beginning of
the fine Season, his Majesty went thither accordingly.</p>

<p>The King's Departure being resolv'd on, I
begg'd his Majesty's leave, to make the Campaign
in <i>Flanders</i> in quality of a Voluntier.
I set out from <i>Berlin</i> with the <i>Gens d'Arms</i>,
in which my Brother was a Cornet, and we
join'd the Army near <i>Louvain</i>. The Count
<i>de Lottum</i> receiv'd me as a Voluntier; and
I had the Pleasure to be near him all the
Campaign. Not many days after I had reached
the Army, the Electoral Prince of <i>Hanover</i>,
(now <i>George</i> II. King of <i>England</i>) arrived
in the Camp of my Lord <i>Marlborough</i>, and did
that General the Honor to serve with him as a
Voluntier. The young Prince distinguish'd himself
very much in this Campaign, and gave the<!--082.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
<i>English</i> sufficient Proof that he was worthy hereafter
of wearing their Crown. 'Twas in this
Campaign that the famous Battel of <i>Audenarde</i>
was fought, in which the <i>French</i> were again
obliged to yield to the Efforts of the Allies.
It must be said however, in their favor, that they
were forc'd to fight without Artillery; for they
had but four Pieces of Cannon, the rest of their
Ordnance and Baggage not being yet arriv'd.
The Action was very hot on both sides; they
fought for several Hours with exceeding Obstinacy,
and always with a considerable Loss on the part
of the Enemy; whose Infantry was not only put
to the rout, but a great many Squadrons of the
<i>French</i> King's Houshold Troops; which advanc'd
to support the Foot; were cut in pieces;
whereupon the Confusion was so great, and the
fire so furious in several places at once, that
'twas almost impossible to distinguish the Allies
from the Enemy; therefore Orders were given
to fire no more till next Morning, but to let the
Enemy escape, rather than run the risque of
putting our own Army in confusion.</p>

<p>The Night being come, the <i>French</i> scarce
made any more Resistance but retir'd by the
way that goes from <i>Audenarde</i> to <i>Ghent</i>, thro'
the Village of <i>Heusden</i>. This very Evening as
I was standing with some Officers of the Guards,
at a small distance from the <i>Prussian</i> Guards, I
perceiv'd a Trooper riding full speed towards us,
who, when he arriv'd said, <i>Gentlemen, the Duke</i>
de Vendosme <i>orders you to retire towards</i> Ghent.
I cannot express to you how much he was surpriz'd
when we told him for Answer, That he
was a Prisoner. <i>Kill me</i>, said he, <i>upon the spot,
I don't desire to out-live what has happened to me</i>.
We comforted him as well as we cou'd, and carried<!--083.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
him to the Count <i>de Lottum</i>'s Quarters, to
whom he made himself known for M. <i>Duplanti</i>,
Aid de Camp to the Duke <i>de Vendosme</i>. What
led him into the mistake was the Habit of the
<i>Prussian</i> Guards, which is not very different from
that of the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>The Battle of <i>Audenarde</i> was the more glorious
for the Allies, because it was a Victory
gain'd over the Duke of <i>Burgundy</i> who commanded
the Army of <i>France</i>, and had with him
the Duke of <i>Berry</i> his Brother, and the Chevalier
<i>de St. George</i>; but they say this Battle was
quite against the Opinion of the Duke <i>de Vendosme</i>,
whose Advice was not hearken'd to, and
the Cabals which the Duke of <i>Burgundy</i> gave
into, hinder'd the Designs of that famous General
from being follow'd, and were the Cause
of the Loss of the Battle.</p>

<p>Next day about ten o'clock at Night the
Count <i>de Lottum</i> was detach'd from the Grand
Army with forty Squadrons and thirty Battalions,
and without any Resistance took possession,
of the Lines towards <i>Ypres</i>, which were immediately
demolish'd. The 19th of that Month
was celebrated by the Army as a Day of
Thanksgiving for the Victory they had
gain'd; upon which all the Cannon were fir'd,
and there was a triple Salvo of all the small
Arms.</p>

<p>On the 26th, my Lord <i>Marlborough</i>, who only
waited for a Convoy of the heavy Artillery to
begin the Siege of <i>Lisle</i>, sent a Detachment to
<i>Brussels</i>, where there was a considerable Train,
which came partly from <i>Sas van Ghent</i> and
<i>Maestricht</i>. This March was cover'd by 22,000
Men of Prince <i>Eugene</i>'s Army, which he himself
commanded in Person. This great Convoy arriving<!--084.png--><span class="pagenum">78</span>
safe before <i>Lisle</i>, the Town was invested
the 13th of <i>August</i>. As it was one of the most
considerable Sieges that had been undertaken for
a long time; and as 'twas natural to expect a vigorous
Resistance, on the part of the Marshal <i>de
Boufflers</i> who commanded in the Place, there
came Voluntiers from all Quarters to the Camp of
the Besiegers. Two great Princes, both able Generals,
thought fit to be present at this Siege,
<i>viz.</i> the King of <i>Poland</i> and the Landgrave of
<i>Hesse-Cassel</i>, who were at the opening of the
Trenches, which was on the 22d at Night.</p>

<p>Some Days after, the Enemy approach'd so
near to us, that it was believed they had an Inclination
to engage. Our Generals were therefore at the
head of the Army as soon as the Day broke.
Prince <i>Eugene</i> join'd my Lord <i>Marlborough</i> with
twenty-six Battalions and seventy-six Squadrons
of his Army which form'd the Siege; and the
Army being drawn up in three Lines, of which
the two foremost consisted of the Cavalry; they
remain'd in this Posture till about ten o' clock in
the Forenoon, when 'twas visible that the Enemy
had no mind to come to a Battle, and that
they only meant to disturb us; for which Reason
the Generals caus'd Entrenchments to be cast up,
which were finish'd next Day, and the Detachment
which Prince <i>Eugene</i> brought, was sent
back again, excepting some Squadrons that
staid.</p>

<p>There was then so little Apprehension of an
Attack, that most of the Generals quitted the
Grand Army to assist in the storming of the
Counterscarp, which happen'd on the 5th of
<i>September</i> at Night. Our Men earned it, tho'
with very great Loss on our side, and made
Lodgments on it. When this Attack was over,<!--085.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
we set out to return to the Grand Army; but to
our misfortune the Guide that had conducted us,
was run away; and as it was not then more than
one or two o'clock in the Morning, we were in
a very great Perplexity, and fell exactly into the
Road that led to the Centre of the Enemy's
Camp. I was on horseback, perhaps a hundred
Yards from the Count <i>de Lottum</i> who was in his
Coach, when all on a sudden I heard some body
call out, <i>Who goes there?</i> I confess to you, <i>Madame</i>
that I was somewhat surpriz'd, but I comforted
my self with the Thought, that it was perhaps
a Centinel of some <i>Walloon</i> Regiment of
the <i>Spanish</i> Troops, so that I answer'd, <i>Officers</i>.
We were got in the midst of Hedges and Trees,
which hinder'd me of the Benefit of a little Moonlight,
by which I might perhaps have discover'd
with whom we had to do; and therefore I still
went on: but I was no sooner out of the Thicket,
than I found my self near enough to a Body
of Horse, to discern that 'twas impossible it
shou'd belong to us, because it was too near the
Place, and because it fronted us. I presently saw
our Danger; I turn'd back as gently as I cou'd
possibly to the Count <i>de Lottum</i>, and told him
what I had observ'd. M. <i>de K&mdash;&mdash;</i> his first Adjutant
call'd me a Simpleton. <i>Kraut</i> the second Adjutant
treated me in much the same Stile; and in
short I had like to have been dismissed for a
Fool; only the Count <i>de Lottum</i> thought it was
Wisdom to run no hazard, and therefore he order'd
his Coachman to turn about, and the Officer
of the Ordnance was detach'd to see whether I
was mistaken. The Truth of the Fact being by
him confirm'd, the Adjutants were almost
frighten'd out of their Wits, made a thousand Apologies,
and promis'd to make me any sort of<!--086.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
amends, if we were but so fortunate as to escape
the Danger which threaten'd us. At last we were
delivered out of it, I don't well know how; for
had the Enemy advanc'd ever so little, we were
sure of being left dead on the Spot.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>Madame</i>, have I given you what pass'd
most remarkable since the Storm of the Counterscarp.
On the 11th, some Motion was made on
the part of the Enemy, who even advanc'd almost
up to our Trenches; but we were in a Posture
to receive them. Their Army lay all
Night under Arms, and next Morning at Daybreak
drew up in Order of Battle, but contrary to
our Expectation nothing came of it; for the
Princes of <i>France</i>, the Chevalier <i>de St. George</i>, the
Duke <i>de Vendosme</i>, and several General Officers
contented themselves with taking a View of our
Camp; but as they advanc'd somewhat too near
to our Intrenchments, we were oblig'd to be a
little rude to such great Princes, and to let fly
some Cannon-Ball among them, whereupon they
thought fit to retire.</p>

<p>My Lord Duke heard the same Day, that M.
<i>de Chamillard</i>, Secretary at War, was arriv'd from
<i>Versailles</i> in the Army of <i>France</i>, to be present at
a Council which was to be held there. It was
therein resolv'd, That we should not be attack'd,
and that their only Business should be to cut off
our Convoys from <i>Brussels</i>. To execute this
Project they posted themselves behind the <i>Scheld</i>,
from whence they indeed did very much incommode
us. We had no Passage left now but from
<i>Ostend</i>, by which General <i>Webb</i> brought us a considerable
Convoy. M. <i>de la Motte</i>, a Lieutenant-General
of the <i>French</i> Army endeavor'd to hinder
its Passage; he had also the Advantage of
the Ground. Nevertheless he was defeated near<!--087.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
<i>Wynendale</i>. To this Convoy may be ascrib'd
the Conquest of <i>Lisle</i>, which was at length oblig'd
to surrender on the 28th of <i>October</i>, and
the Marshal <i>de Boufflers</i> retir'd into the Citadel;
yet as brave as the Garison was that march'd
into it with him, he could not hold it out long.
Thus the Allies gain'd some considerable Advantage
or other every day. Never did they
make a more glorious Campaign; for besides the
taking of <i>Lisle</i> and its Citadel, they had also the
Glory in this same Campaign of raising the Siege
which the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i> had laid to <i>Brussels</i>,
and of reducing <i>Ghent</i> and <i>Bruges</i>.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you, that during the Siege of
<i>Lisle</i>, we had like to have lost Prince <i>Eugene</i>.
This Prince receiv'd a Packet one day by the
Post, and having broke it open, he saw a greasy
Paper, which gave him a mistrust; but he
only threw it upon the Ground, and a Person
that gathered it up being taken ill, it induc'd
them to make an Experiment upon a Dog, which
when they had rubb'd it about his Nose, died
that Instant. Thus was God pleas'd to preserve
this Hero from the basest of Treasons.</p>

<p>I wish'd I could have been at the taking of
<i>Lisle</i>, but was oblig'd to quit the Army some
time before, M. <i>Dankelman</i> my Tutor having receiv'd
the King's Orders to send me to <i>Berlin</i>,
where his Majesty design'd to give me a Place at
Court; and as he had Thoughts of marrying again,
he propos'd to prefer me to an Employment
under the new Queen.</p>

<p>The King's Marriage was talk'd of at the Waters
of <i>Carelsbadt</i>. I have had the honor to acquaint
you, <i>Madame</i>, that the Physicians not
knowing what Remedy to prescribe, for curing
him of the Faintness, which was the Relic of his<!--088.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
great illness in 1707, had at all adventures order'd
the Waters of <i>Carelsbadt</i>, and the King
was perfectly recover'd by them. The Recovery
of his Health reviv'd the Pleasures of the
Court. The voluptuous Courtier, who had not
yet forgot what the Presence of an amiable Queen
is capable of doing, began to form Vows, that
the King might make a Choice as good as
the first: nay, the matter was carried farther;
it was mention'd to his Majesty, who was
told withal, that nothing was more necessary,
than to think immediately of a second Marriage;
and that the Prince Royal having no Children,
there was Danger of his Majesty's leaving
no Issue. In short, every body voted so heartily
for a Marriage, that the King, who also was
desirous of it, declar'd he wou'd marry again.
The only difficulty was to know, who should be
the Princess that was to be advanc'd to the Throne;
and then arose several Parties, who had each
very different Views.</p>

<p>The Great Chamberlain was for the Princess of
<i>Nassau-Friesland</i>, a Marriage with whom, he
imagin'd, would put an end to all the Disputes
about King <i>William</i>'s Succession. The King
approv'd of the Proposal, and sent the Baron <i>de
Schalifer</i> to negociate the Treaty. You would
not believe perhaps, <i>Madame</i>, that the very
Mother of this Princess caus'd it to miscarry, from
a Jealousy of her Daughter's Grandeur. Her
Pretext was, that she had before vainly flatter'd herself
with the Hopes of marrying her Daughter to
the Prince Royal; that she had been bubbled then;
and that it would be the same thing now. The Assurances
that the Baron gave her to the contrary,
and the Advantages he shew'd her would accrue
to her Family from this Match, were all to no<!--089.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
purpose; she remain'd inflexible; and told him in
plain Terms, that she could not bear to think of
seeing her Daughter so much above her. The
Baron having made some other Attempts, this
jealous Mother prevail'd on her Daughter to
refuse the greatest Offer she could ever hope for.
A great many of the Courtiers were not sorry to
see this Match broke off. They had been jealous
for a long time of the great Credit of the
Prince of <i>Anhalt</i>, who being Uncle to the Princess
in question, 'twas natural to presume, that
she would grow more powerful than before, besides
the being more united than ever to the
Great Chamberlain, to whom the Prince would
be oblig'd for this Marriage.</p>

<p>Then the Princess of <i>Hesse</i> was propos'd, and the
Princess of <i>Culmbach</i>. The former had the Negative
put upon her the very Moment that she
was mention'd, and that by the King himself.
The latter was known to the King, who had seen
her at <i>Hall</i>, as he return'd from <i>Carelsbadt</i>. His
Majesty thought very well of her, and had even
seem'd inclinable to determine in her favor, when,
opposite Cabals were set at work, which quite
frustrated the Proposal.</p>

<p>The Duchess of <i>Zeitz</i>, the King's Sister, who
married a Duke of <i>Meckelbourg</i> to her first Husband,
proposed the Princess of <i>Meckelbourg</i> to
the King. His Majesty, who had still perhaps
the Princess of <i>Culmbach</i> in his Thoughts, did not
seem at first to relish this Proposal; nevertheless
upon the Instances made to him by the Duchess
his Sister, he promised her to see the Princess
of <i>Meckelbourg</i> before he determin'd in favor
of any other Person. This he did accordingly,
some time after he return'd to <i>Berlin</i>, when he
went to <i>Schwerin</i>, the Capital City of <i>Meckelbourg</i>,<!--090.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
on pretence of endeavoring to accommodate
the Differences between the Duke and the
Nobility. There it was that the King saw the
Princess; she pleas'd him, and besides he had
heard so much in her Praise, that at length he
determin'd to have her; and as soon as he return'd
to <i>Oranienbourg</i>, he declared his Marriage.</p>

<p>This News did not create so much Joy at
our Court as I imagin'd it wou'd; and the Courtiers
began to reflect seriously, upon what they had
seem'd to wish for with Impatience. They call'd
to mind the Time of the late Queen. Moreover,
the Age and Health of the Prince and Princess
Royal gave them ground enough to hope,
that the <i>Brandenburg</i> Family would not want
Heirs. In fine, the Character of Mother-in-law,
ever hated, gave Apprehension that there wou'd
soon be a Division in the Royal Family. For
my own part, I verily believe, <i>Madame</i>, that
what most of all disgusted the Courtiers, in the
Choice which the King had now made, was,
that the Queen was a devout Lady, a Quality
not very likely to make that Air of Gallantry
prevail at Court, which captivates the Heart of
the Courtier.</p>

<p>The King had no sooner declar'd his Intention
to marry again, but there was a Multitude of
Sollicitors to be of the Queen's Houshold. One
<i>Bassompierre</i> put himself upon the List, and he
desir'd the King wou'd make him the Queen's
Chamberlain. The King made him answer,
that he would put no Officers about the Queen,
except such as should be agreeable to her; but
that he would favor him so far, as to put him in
the number of those that shou'd be propos'd to
the Queen as soon as she arriv'd. <i>Bassompierre</i><!--091.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
thought that by making previous Application to
the Queen, he should not fail of being admitted,
and therefore he set out Post to meet her. He
told her Majesty that the King had sent him to
be her Chamberlain. The Queen believ'd him,
admitted him in that quality, and also gave him
a Letter to carry to the King, with which he return'd
to <i>Berlin</i>. He told the King, that the
Queen had appointed him her Chamberlain. His
Majesty easily imagin'd that the Queen had been
surpriz'd; and being justly angry with <i>Bassompierre</i>,
forbad him the Court. This <i>Bassompierre</i>
had a Brother who came to <i>Berlin</i> the same time
as he did: These two Gentlemen said they were
of that honest Family of <i>Bassompierre</i>, of which
there are some still in <i>Lorrain</i>: And by that
Name they went, <i>Anno</i> 1707, in the Army in
<i>Flanders</i>. The eldest said he had been a Colonel
in <i>France</i>, and that his Brother was a Captain in
the same Regiment. They pretended that they
left their Country, the eldest for having fought a
Duel, and the youngest for being his Second. The
King had receiv'd them kindly, and given them
Pensions, with a Promise to prefer them to the
Army the first Opportunity that should offer.
These two Brothers were at Court in a very
agreeable Situation, and wou'd, no doubt, have long
enjoy'd it, when the eldest attempted to be the
Queen's Chamberlain; in which perhaps too he
would have succeeded, if his Eagerness for it
had not made him take that Step, by which he
incurr'd his Majesty's Indignation. He was very
much astonish'd at the Order which was signify'd
to him, not to be seen any more at Court; and
at length fearing he shou'd be found out to be
what he really was, he retir'd, and went with his
Brother to <i>Saxony</i>, where they were both admitted<!--092.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
into the King of <i>Poland</i>'s Horse-Guards;
but they did not enjoy that Shelter long: for the
Electoress of <i>Hanover</i> having heard of their Intrigue
at <i>Berlin</i>, wrote to a great Lady in <i>France</i>,
and desir'd her to inform her who those <i>Bassompierres</i>
were. The Lady, who knew nothing at all
of 'em, naturally mistrusted that they were Fortune-Hunters;
but for better Information she
enquir'd of M. <i>d'Argenson</i>, Lieutenant of the
Police, who upon the Description given him of
those Gentlemen, discover'd they were a couple
of Sparks, whose Duel of Honor wou'd have
been rewarded with the Brand of the <i>Flower de Lis</i>
and the Galleys, if they could have been apprehended
in <i>France</i>. Upon this Discovery Messieurs
<i>de Bassompierre</i> were banish'd out of <i>Poland</i>,
and what became of them afterwards I cannot
tell.</p>

<p>Mean time all the necessary Preparations were
making at <i>Berlin</i> for the Reception of the Queen,
who was preparing on her part for her public
Entry. The Duke of <i>Meckelbourg</i> married
the Princess his Sister by Proxy from the King.
Next day the new Queen set out from <i>Schwerin</i>,
in company with the Duchess her Mother, the
Duke her Brother, and the Duchess of <i>Meckelbourg</i>
her Sister-in law. This Train went with
her to the very Frontier of <i>Meckelbourg</i>, which
borders upon the Electorate of <i>Brandenburg</i>, and
there the Queen found M. <i>d'Erlach</i>, Marshal
of the Court, who receiv'd her in the King's
Name, and offer'd her his House. This Princess,
after having taken leave of her Family,
took Coach and arriv'd at <i>Oranienburg</i> the 24th
of <i>November</i>. The King went and met her about
half a League from that House. As soon
as she perceiv'd his Majesty, she alighted out of<!--093.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
her Coach and fell on her Knees. The King
took her up and embrac'd her, and after presenting
the whole Royal Family to her they went
to the Castle. The King conducted the Queen
to her Apartment, where she always eat alone,
to the very Day of the Celebration of the Marriage.
The 27th she made her Entry at <i>Berlin</i>,
where she was receiv'd with all possible Magnificence,
and next Day their Majesties were married
in the Church of the <i>Dome</i>. The 29th, the
King and Queen receiv'd the Compliments of all
the Deputies, Courts of Justice and Foreign Ministers;
and on the same day there was a great
Entertainment which their Majesties honor'd
with their Presence. I was not willing, <i>Madame</i>,
to tire you with a tedious Detail of all the Ceremonies:
I have already had the Honor to acquaint
you, that the King spar'd for nothing that
might contribute to the Magnificence of the
Feast, which lasted several days, and was more
sumptuous every day than other. What I thought
remarkable, was a Battle of wild Beasts, at which
their Majesties were present on the 17th of <i>December</i>,
when the Queen kill'd a Bear from her
Gallery, with a shot from a Hand-Gun.</p>

<p>The Arrival of the new Queen created no
great Change at Court, and except the first Rank
which she had of the Ladies every thing continued
in the same state. The Princess-Royal
kept her Court at her own Lodgings twice a
Week, that is to say, on those Days when there
was no Circle at the Queen's; for upon the
Drawing-Room Days she went to her Majesty's
Apartment, as did most of the Princesses, and
they stay'd there to sup. Her Majesty likewise
granted the same Honor to several other Ladies,<!--094.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
to whom she gave an Invitation by a Gentleman
when they were in the Circle.</p>

<p>'Twas at the time of the King's Marriage that I
lost my Father-in-law: I was very much concern'd
for his Death, especially on account of the Trouble
it gave my Mother, who could never get over it
as long as she liv'd. The very day that the
News of it was brought to me, the King declar'd
me a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber. I
have had the Honor to tell you, <i>Madame</i>, that
I was taken out of the Army in hopes of being
plac'd near the Queen, but when I came to
Court I found all her Houshold settled, and my
Name not in the List. I spoke of this to the
Grand Marshal, who bid me not be vexed, for
that he would shortly get me a Post about the
King, and that was the Office of Gentleman of
the Bed-chamber, to which I was nominated
some time after, <i>i. e.</i> about the latter end of the
Year 1708.</p>

<p>You know, <i>Madame</i>, and one can hardly forget
the prodigious cold Weather we had the
Winter following. It began on the Feast of
<i>Epiphany</i>, 1709, and was universal all over <i>Europe</i>.
The Corn and Vines suffer'd so much by
it that there was a scarcity which lasted long enough
to starve a number of poor People, who
cou'd not get Bread, it was so excessive dear.
Never was there a more melancholy Year; and
there was such a poor melancholy Court all the
while, that it seem'd as if the severe cold Weather
had chill'd our Spirits. But when the fine
Weather return'd they began to revive, and every
one prepar'd to set out for the Army. The
Prince Royal went to make the Campaign in
<i>Flanders</i> as a Voluntier, and M. <i>d'Arnheim</i> departed
to rejoin the Troops of which he had the<!--095.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Command in <i>Piedmont</i>. This Campaign was
very glorious to the Allies, but 'twas a very
bloody one. The famous Battle of <i>Malplaquet</i>
was one of those Victories which procured us
Laurels cover'd with Funeral Scutcheons, and
two more such Victories would have ruin'd the
Infantry of the Allies. The Prince Royal was
Witness of the Bravery of our Troops, which
distinguish'd themselves in this Campaign, wherein
they had been great Sufferers. The Enemy
on their part besides the Battle lost also <i>Mons</i>
and <i>Tournay</i>.</p>

<p>I could have wish'd to have made this Campaign,
but when I ask'd the King's Leave to go,
his Majesty refus'd me, saying, that he design'd
me for some other Business than that of Arms.
This Answer pleas'd me to the Life, and as I
was young and by consequence apt enough to
be vain, I was so simple as to believe my self
for a while in the highest Favor. But I was
soon convinc'd of my mistake. What serv'd to
open my Eyes was this. The Post of Gentleman
of the Bed-chamber, with which the King
had honor'd me, made it my duty to attend
the King's Coach on horseback as often as his
Majesty went abroad; but being one day so much
out of order that 'twas impossible for me to ride
a Horse, as ill luck would have it, the King happen'd
to go that very day from<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><i>Charlottenbourg</i>
to <i>Berlin</i>, and perceiv'd that I was not upon
Duty. This incens'd him so much against
me, that when I attended to receive his Hat and
Cane upon his Return, he said the harshest things
that cou'd be to me, the least of which was, that
if I ever fail'd in my Duty again, he would deprive
me of the Honor of serving him. Guess,<!--096.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
<i>Madame</i>, how much I was mortify'd at such a
Reprimand given in presence of eight or ten
Persons that were in the King's Chamber. Indeed
I had much ado to brook it, and at first dash
I really had a Thought of resigning my Post.
I spoke of it to the Count <i>de Witgenstein</i>, who
pacify'd me a little by giving me to understand,
that if I did not abate of my Fire I had nothing
to do but to renounce all Advancement in the
Service of my King, a Service always preferable
to any Fortunes that can be made at the Court
of any Foreign Prince. He promis'd to set me
right in the King's Opinion, and he kept his
Word; for two or three Days afterwards as the
King return'd to <i>Charlottenbourg</i>, when I happen'd
to be all alone in his Chamber with the
Chamberlain in waiting, his Majesty did me the
Honor to ask me, <i>If I was still in a Pet?</i> I return'd
no other Answer but a profound Obeisance.
The King said to me a second time, <i>I ask you if
you are out of humor because I chid you t'other
day?</i> I made Answer with all the Respect possible,
<i>That indeed I was vex'd to my heart that
I had given his Majesty any Cause to be out of
Temper with me; that no body was more ambitious
than I was of serving him faithfully; and
that tho' I had the Misfortune lately to be wanting
in my Duty, it was owing to a very sad Indisposition.</i>
<i>But</i>, said the King, <i>you should have let
me know it then, and I should not have reprimanded
you. After all, I did so only to try you, for in
the main I was not so angry as I seem'd to be.</i>
<i>Jackel</i> the King's Jester, who was present at this
Conversation, took up the Discourse and said to
the King, <i>But, good Sir, the Indisposition he talks
of, is of his own making; for the true Cause is,
he has no Saddle-Horses, and the reason of this, is</i><!--097.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
<i>because he has not wherewithal to feed them.</i> <i>Why
then</i>, said the King, <i>I will give him wherewithal:
The Great Chamberlain</i>, said he to me, <i>shall dispatch
you a Warrant for that purpose; go to him.</i> I
then advanc'd to kiss the King's Robe, but he
drew back, and as I was stooping he laid his
Hand upon my Head, and said to me, <i>You are
young, be good, and I will take care of you.</i> In
a few days after, I had my Warrant dispatch'd
to send for Forage to <i>Michlenhoff</i>, where the
like was distributed to other Courtiers who had
obtain'd the same Favor.</p>

<p>At the same time the Duke of <i>Meckelbourg</i>
the Queen's Brother came to <i>Berlin</i>, where he
had a magnificent Reception, yet he was not
very well pleas'd with his Journey; for this
Prince expected, as he was a Sovereign, to have
Precedency of the Margraves the King's Brothers,
which was deny'd him. He eat in private
with the King, but the Margraves were
not present, and he stay'd at Court but three or
four days, during which he was lodg'd at the
Palace and serv'd by the King's Officers.</p>

<p>As for our new Queen she became so devout
in a little time after her Marriage, that every body
was surpriz'd, and the Courtiers very much disgusted.
Nothing was talk'd of in her presence
but Religion, and in the Morning her Anti-chamber
was frequented by Ministers, by Dr.
<i>Francke</i> whom she had sent for on purpose from
<i>Hall</i>, and by <i>Borst</i> her Confessor. It look'd as
if one was in the Anti-chamber of some Governess
of a Convent, rather than in the Palace of
a great Queen. Under pretence of Prayers for
Deliverance from the Plague which infected some
of our Provinces, there was nothing to be heard
in her Apartments but Litanies. The King<!--098.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
did not like all this Cant; for tho' he had a great
deal of Religion, he did not love Bigotry. He
made the Queen sensible that her manner of living
was not suitable to one that sate upon a
Throne, and got her content to the Removal of
those Persons from about her who had exhorted
her to embrace the Party of the Pietists. <i>Francke</i>
was sent back to <i>Hall</i> to the great College which
the Queen had newly founded for Orphans, and
whereof that Doctor had the Direction. Then
there was only <i>Borst</i> her Majesty's Confessor left
at Court, and he was advis'd not to give himself
so much Trouble about the Queen's Salvation.
This Princess was so zealous for her Religion,
that she did not believe those who profess'd a
contrary one could be saved. I remember that
one day as she was talking about Religion to the
King, she told him that she was very much
grieved to find him a <i>Calvinist</i>, and by that
means out of the Road to Salvation. The King
who seem'd in an amaze at the Compliment, said
to her, <i>What, do you think then that I shall be
damn'd? And what will you say then when you
speak of me after Death</i>? For you could not
say <i>der SEELIGE Konig</i>, (an Expression us'd in
the <i>German</i> Tongue, speaking of a Person deceas'd,
and which signifies, the <i>King is sav'd</i>.)
The Queen was a little puzzled how to reply,
but after a few Moments Reflection she said, I
will say, <i>der liebe verstorbene Konig</i>, which signifies
the <i>Dear King deceas'd</i>. This Answer made the
King uneasy, who return'd soon after to his Apartment.
I was that day in Waiting, and by
consequence in his Majesty's Apartment with some
of the Court-Nobility, when the King told us
with a deal of Concern upon his Mind of the
Conversation he had with the Queen, which affected<!--099.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
him the more, because at that time he
thought very seriously of the Union of the <i>Protestant</i>
Churches.</p>

<p>Mean time the Pestilence, which had discover'd
it self in some of our Provinces, frighten'd
us very much. The King upon this occasion
acted like a true Father of his People, by sending
Money and Provisions to those that were afflicted
with it, and by causing a Day of solemn Fasting
and Prayers to be celebrated in all the Churches
of his Dominions to beg of God that he wou'd
please to avert this Scourge from our Country.
Moreover he caused Lazarets or Pest-Houses to
be erected at the Gates of all the Towns where
those who came from any suspected Place were
to perform Quarantain. As the whole time was
now spent in Sermons and Prayers for removing
the Pestilence, the detail of which would not be
very pleasing, I think it will not be amiss here
to tell you how the Service was perform'd before
the King and Queen. I will begin by giving
you some Account of<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><i>Berlin</i>, and of his
Majesty's<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>Palace.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Berlin</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> wou'd not have been
what it is at this day, had it not been for the
<i>French</i> Protestants. They had been kindly receiv'd
by the Elector <i>Frederic-William</i>: And
the King, every whit as generous as his Father,
prolong'd and even augmented the Franchises
granted to the <i>French</i>, and in order to convince
those Exiles that he was dispos'd to be a Father<!--100.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to them, he had a mind that they should be no longer
distinguish'd from his natural-born Subjects;
but caus'd Churches to be built for them of which
he maintain'd the Ministers, gave them a very
fine College for the Education of their Children,
and also chose a Company of Musketeers out of
them in which none but <i>French</i> were admitted.</p>

<p>These Refugees were so sensible of the King's
Goodness to them, that they had an Emulation
to shew their Gratitude to him by making Trade
to flourish. They were equally zealous for the
embellishing and aggrandizing of the City, and
caus'd a great many Houses to be built there
which were both neat and commodious. They
added to the City all that Quarter call'd the
<i>New Town</i>, which is certainly the most beautiful
part of <i>Berlin</i>. Of the Streets which run in a
strait Line, the principal is adorn'd with six
Rows of Lime-Trees that form as many Walks,
the middlemost of which is lin'd with a Balustrade
to keep off Coaches and Carriages. These
Walks terminate in a Wood, thro' which there's
an Avenue of a League, which leads to <i>Charlottenbourg</i>,
a Royal Palace.</p>

<p>At the Entrance of the <i>New Town</i> there's the
Arsenal<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, a Structure which may pass for one of
the finest in <i>Europe</i>: 'Tis a Quadrangle with a
large Square in the middle. The four outward
Fronts are almost exactly alike. The principal
is divided into three Buildings, of which that in
the middle projects a little forwards. The
Grand Floor consists of Arches charged with
Rustics, which support Pilasters of the <i>Ionic</i> Order.
The part which projects from the middle<!--101.png--><span class="pagenum">95</span>
is adorn'd with four Columns, and has a large
Pediment at the end of it. The grand or principal
Gate is in the middle. On the two sides
there are four great fine Statues representing the
Cardinal Virtues on Pedestals. These seem to look
towards the King's Picture, which is represented
in a great Medal of Brass gilt in the coping of
the Gate. Over this Picture, there's his Majesty's
Cypher in the middle of a Cartridge
crown'd, supported by Fame and Victory. The
Cartridge is fill'd up with an Entablature upon
which there's a <i>Latin</i> Inscription in Letters of
Gold, to the Honor of the King. Finally, over
this Entablature there's a great Pediment in Basso-Relievo
perfectly beautiful, representing a <i>Mars</i>
which seems to rest upon a Trophy, and to look
upon a couple of Slaves chain'd at his Feet.
The whole is compleated by a Balustrade which
rests upon the Pedestals that support the Trophies.
This stately Edifice is encompass'd with
Spurs of Iron in the form of Cannon, upon
which there's the King's Cypher gilt; and these
Spurs serve for a Support to the Iron Chains
which are hung in Festoons from one to the other.</p>

<p>The Inside of this Structure is as magnificent
as the Outside. Two Rows of Pillars support
the lowermost Arch-Roof and form three Walks,
of which the middlemost is the narrowest, but
the only one that serves for the Passage; those
on the sides being full of noble Brass-Guns.
The King had a Design to have a Cannon of a
hundred Pounder plac'd at each Corner; but
there is only one finish'd which is call'd <i>Asia</i>, a
terrible Machine fitter to adorn an Arsenal than
for any other use. The Ascent to it is by a Step,
because they were oblig'd to build the Carriage
in proportion to the piece that it bears. This<!--102.png--><span class="pagenum">96</span>
Cannon is adorn'd all over with Eagles and
Crowns; and the King's-Arms are represented
on it under a Royal Pavilion, as are also those of
the Margrave <i>Philip</i> the King's Brother, as Grand Master
of the Artillery. This is all that is remarkable
on the side of the <i>New Town</i>.</p>

<p>The King's Palace is also very magnificent;
and the whole is so majestic, that it appears at
the first sight to be the Residence of some great
Monarch. Yet there's one fault in it, which is,
that Uniformity has not been nicely observ'd in
it, because it has been carry'd on by Fits and
Girds, and every Architect has followed his particular
Plan.</p>

<p>This Palace consists of four large Buildings,
which forms in the middle a Court that is not so
broad as 'tis long. The first Thing in the main
Front is a great high Portico with two Gates
Arch-wise on the two sides. The Proportions
of the Columns and the Height of the Portico
were copy'd from <i>Constantine</i>'s Triumphal Arch
at <i>Rome</i>. On the two sides of the Portico there
are twelve great Transom Windows encompass'd
with Ornaments. The Fronts that are on the
side of the Court are much more magnificent
than the outer ones, but then they are more irregular.
The Inside of the Palace is not executed
much better. Two Grand Stair-Cases lead to
the Guard-Room, the one on the Right and the
other on the Left of the Entry. The Stair-Case
on the Left-hand is of a particular Contrivance,
being in form of a Glacis without any Step, so
that a Coach may go up to it. The Guard-Room
is long but narrow, and has no Light but
what comes from the Windows on the Cupola
over the Stair-Case. The Entry is in the middle.
There is a Turning on the Left to enter into the<!--103.png--><span class="pagenum">97</span>
King's Apartment, which shews at first sight
three Chambers in a Row. The third of these
Rooms separates the least Apartment from the
greatest, of which the former is on the Right and
the latter on the Left. I will only speak to you
of the last, which is the most magnificent. In
turning therefore to the Left one perceives a long
Suite of Apartments, which form a magnificent
Point of View. The Furniture is surprizingly
rich; nor is any thing to be seen, look which
way you will, but Gold, Silver, Marble, Brass,
Painting, Glass, China, <i>&amp;c.</i> in a word, every
thing that can be wish'd for, that is rich and elegant.
At the end of this Suite of Apartments
there is a long Gallery, the Cieling of which, like
that of <i>Versailles</i>, represents the principal Actions
of the King, and the sides are adorn'd with Pictures
done by the most famous Hands, the
Frames of which are of Brass gilt.</p>

<p>At the end of this Gallery there was formerly
a great Amber-Cabinet, with divers Compartiments
in Basso-Relievo, which perhaps had not
its Fellow in the World; but the King being desirous
to make the <i>Czar</i> a Present worthy of his
Acceptance, gave him this Cabinet and a Yatcht
that cost eighty thousand Crowns.</p>

<p>Were I to enter into the detail of the Beauties
and Magnificence one meets with at every step
in this Palace, I should never have done; I believe
it may be sufficient to say that the King, as
far as possible, imitated the Inside of the Palace
of <i>Versailles</i>. This great Prince took <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
for a Model, and after his Example was intent
on building magnificent Structures and establishing
different Manufactures, whereby the Poor
might earn their Living, and get for a reasonable
Price those Commodities which heretofore they<!--104.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
used to import from Foreign Countries, at a very
great Expence. Thus, <i>Madame</i>, have I given
you an account of almost all the greatest Remarkables
at <i>Berlin</i>. I shall now let you know
after what manner their Majesties are every day
attended.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>I begin with the King's Levee. His Majesty
commonly rose between five and six o'clock in
the Morning, (I mean at the time that I have the
Honour to speak to you of;) tho' formerly he
rose at three or four o'clock. As soon as the
King awak'd, the Page of the Back-Stairs who had
watch'd with him went and gave notice of it to
the Valets de Chambre and the Yeomen of the
Wardrobe, who presently came in, undrew the
Bed-Curtains, and open'd the Window-Shutters,
after which they went out and declar'd that the
King was stirring. Then the Chamberlain in
waiting, the Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and
the Officers upon Guard came in and made a very
low Bow. The next that enter'd were the Physicians,
to whom his Majesty gave an account
how he had rested. Then the Pages of the Back-Stairs
brought a great Silver Table with Coffee
upon it, which was presented to the King by the
first Valet de Chambre in waiting upon a Gold
Salver, and the Page presented it about to all the
Persons of Quality that were at the Levee. Every
body was oblig'd to drink two Cups, or else
they run the risk of being reprimanded. After
drinking of the Coffee the Table was carry'd away,
and the King convers'd half an hour or
more with those that were present: Then he
veil'd his Bonnet and all the Company retir'd.
The Valets de Chambre and the Grooms of the<!--105.png--><span class="pagenum">99</span>
Wardrobe stay'd to dress the King, which when
they had done, his Majesty retir'd into his Closet,
where was a Desk for Prayer, and there he commonly
stay'd an Hour, while they made his Bed.
After this he return'd into his Chamber, and then
the Prime Minister came in to give him an account
of his Dispatches, which lasted till ten
o'clock or thereabouts. After this the King went
to Council, where he stay'd a little above an Hour.
This Council consisted of the Prince Royal, the
Margrave <i>Philip</i> Brother to the King, and the
Ministers. When the Council broke up the
King went into his Closet, and there gave out
his Orders. Then two Kettle-Drummers plac'd
in opposite Balconies that look'd into the lesser
Court, gave notice by the Sound of their Kettle-Drums
to the Officers of the Kitchen and Buttery
to get everything ready for the King's Service.
As soon as the Cloth was laid, the Kettle-Drums
were sounded a second time. During this, the
King accompany'd by the Prince Royal and the
Margraves his Brothers, pass'd thro' the Guard-Room
into the Queen's Apartment, where were
all the Princesses. A few moments after, the
Kettle-Drums and twenty-four Trumpets divided
into two Bodies, gave notice for serving up Dinner.
At the same time, two of the Life-Guards
and six of the Guard of Hundred <i>Swissers</i> took
possession of the Room where the King was to
eat. The two Life-Guard Men posted themselves
behind the Arm-Chair of the King and
Queen, and the six <i>Swissers</i> encompass'd the Table
three on each side with their Halberds in their
hands. When Dinner was serv'd up, the Great
Chamberlain with his Staff in hand went and acquainted
the King of it, who immediately enter'd
the Hall, follow'd by the Queen, who was led by<!--106.png--><span class="pagenum">100</span>
the Prince Royal; as were the Princess Royal
and the Margravines by the Margraves. At
their entrance into the Hall, the King gave his
Hat and Cane, and the Queen her Gloves and
Fan, to the Chamberlains in waiting. Then two
Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber held out a great
Silver gilt Bason for them to wash in, and when
they had wash'd, the two Chamberlains gave them
the Napkins. The two Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber
always offer'd the Bason in like manner
to the Princes and Princesses to wash in, but
they wou'd not accept it.</p>

<p>When their Majesties had wash'd, the Grand
Marshal who stood about the middle of the Table
opposite to the King gave a Rap with his Staff;
at the same time making a profound Obeisance;
then a Page that stood by him did the like, and
after saying a short Grace their Majesties seated
themselves in their Arm-Chairs, and their Royal
Highnesses in other Chairs, with only Backs.
Then the Carver approaching the Table tasted
the Provision, and therewith serv'd their Majesties,
and the Princes according to their Rank.
When their Majesties call'd for Liquor the Chamberlain
gave the hint to a Page, and he did the
same to a Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber upon
Duty, who then went to the Side-board and
fetch'd Wine and Water in two Bottles upon a
Salver of Gold. The Chamberlain tasted both,
and then presented both to their Majesties. The
King always drank the Queen's Health, and the
Queen in like manner drank the King's. This
done, their Majesties dismiss'd the Court by making
a Salute to the Grand Marshal. Then the
Court retir'd, and none stay'd but the Waiters.
Before their Majesties rose from Table the Prime
Minister as well as the Master of the Horse approach'd,<!--107.png--><span class="pagenum">101</span>
with the Grand Master of the Wardrobe
and the Captain of the Guards, to receive
the King's Orders, in case his Majesty was willing
to ride out. When the Dessart was ready to
be serv'd, notice was brought to the Grand Marshal
or to him that bore the Staff in his absence,
who then return'd to the King's Table. When
his Majesty rose from Table the Chamberlain
brought him Water to wash his Mouth, and the
Queen's Chamberlain and their Royal Highnesses
Gentlemen attended the Queen and Princesses
with the same. After this the King led the
Queen into her own Apartment, where he stay'd
a little time, then return'd to his own, and rested
himself for an hour in his Closet.</p>

<p>When the King was awaked, the Chamberlain
and the Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber enter'd
his Majesty's Closet, where sometimes the Queen
paid him a Visit, and at other times the Prime
Minister came and talk'd with him about Business.
In the Summer-time the King went abroad
for the Air, or the Pleasure of Fishing or Hunting,
especially the Heron, in which he took great
delight. About six o'clock in the Evening his
Majesty went to the Queen's Apartment, and
stay'd there about an Hour, after which he return'd
to his own, to that call'd <i>la Tabagie</i> or the
Tobacco-Room, because there he smoak'd his
Pipe, and several of the Nobility had the Honour
of smoaking there with him. The King
never supp'd unless it was in extraordinary cases,
but amus'd himself with a Game at Chess. When
he had done playing he conversed very familiarly
with the Chamberlain, the Gentlemen of the
Bed-Chamber, and some privileg'd Courtiers;
and when he had a mind to put an end to the
Conversation, he gave his Orders to the Grand<!--108.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Master of the Wardrobe what Clothes to equip
him with next day, and then every body retir'd,
and the Valets de Chambre and the Grooms of
the Wardrobe went and put his Majesty to bed.
This, <i>Madame</i>, was the manner how the Service
was perform'd at our Court. Never was there
any Interruption in the Hours prescrib'd for his
Majesty's Exercises, unless he labor'd under some
Ailment. I thought that this Detail, tho' perhaps
a little tedious, wou'd not be quite so unpleasant
as the Recital of all the Litanies and other
Prayers, in which the Queen was constant
for the remainder of the Year.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Year following, that
is to say the 19th of <i>January</i> 1710, the Count
<i>de Lottum</i> presented the King with eleven Pieces
of Cannon, and several Colors and Standards that
fell to his Majesty's share in the distribution that
was made of those that were taken from the
<i>French</i>, during the Campaign.</p>

<p>At the same time we lost the Duke of <i>Courland</i>
for ever. This young Prince was the King's
Nephew by his Mother, who was his Majesty's
Sister by the same Father, but not by the same
Mother. He was but an Infant when he lost
his Father the Duke of <i>Courland</i>, whose death
was to him the greatest of all Misfortunes, because
of the Misunderstanding which the Guardianship
of this young Prince created between those who
aspir'd to it. The Duchess his Mother asserted
that she was the rightful Guardian of the Prince,
her Son. His Uncle also pretended 'twas his
Right. In short, the Nobility of <i>Courland</i> disputed
it with them both. During these Domestic
Troubles, the several Parties, not watchful of
their Neighbours Motions, quickly found they
had powerful Enemies to cope with. The <i>Saxons</i><!--109.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
being the nearest, were the most forward to take
possession of their Country. The <i>Muscovites</i>
were soon at their heels, and in concert with the
<i>Saxons</i> rush'd upon what they thought most convenient.
But they were both soon oblig'd to
abandon that Duchy to the King of <i>Sweden</i>, who
came at the head of his Troops, and without
much difficulty sent them going. But after all,
Fortune being weary of seconding the Arms of
the <i>Swedish</i> Monarch, he was oblig'd not long
after his Entrance into <i>Courland</i>, to yield the
said Duchy to the <i>Muscovites</i>, who remain'd the
sole Possessors of it.</p>

<p>All these Troubles had oblig'd the Duchess,
with the Prince her Son, to retire. She came to
<i>Berlin</i> where she was present at the King's Coronation,
and afterwards, as I have already had
the Honor to tell you, she marry'd the Margrave
of <i>Brandenburg Bareith</i>. This Princess
followed the Margrave her Husband into his Dominions,
and took the Duke of <i>Courland</i> her
Son along with her. There did this young
Prince stay with the Margrave his Father-in-law,
till after the King of <i>Sweden</i>'s Defeat at <i>Pultowa</i>
by the <i>Muscovite</i> Army. When the latter were
become Masters of <i>Courland</i>, the Duke flatter'd
himself that he should be able to prevail on the
Czar to restore him to his Dominions: nor was
he deceiv'd in his Expectation; for the Czar was
very ready to consent to it, on condition nevertheless
that he should marry his Niece, the Daughter
of the late Czar, his Brother. The Match
was truly illustrious, for the Princess was both
the Daughter and Niece of a potent Monarch;
but her Education had been very different from
that of the young Prince, and there was all the
Reason in the World to think, that they would<!--110.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
not like one another long. The Duke for his
part could have wish'd to be restor'd to his Duchy
upon other Terms; but at length, thinking he
could not do better than to accept of those, and
to put himself again at the head of his Subjects,
who had for several Years wish'd for his
Presence; he set out for the Czar's Court, and
there married the Princess. This Marriage,
which was concluded with some Reluctance on
the part of the young Duke, seem'd to portend
him none but unhappy Days; and in short, he
was scarce married, but he fell dangerously sick,
and in a few days after died, which Illness they said
was owing to his having been forc'd to drink to
excess on his Wedding-Day. This occasion'd
a general Desolation throughout the Duchy of
<i>Courland</i>, the poor People having entertain'd some
Hopes that the Presence of their lawful Sovereign
would make them forget the Evils they had
suffer'd by several years continual Wars.</p>

<p>Towards the Conclusion of this Year, the famous
Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>, Prime Minister and
Great Chamberlain was disgrac'd; which, tho' it
had been long wish'd for, was surprizing to all
Mankind, who thought the Credit of that Minister
too well establish'd, the chief Places of the
Kingdom being in the hands of his Creatures,
from whose Gratitude there was nothing that he
might not promise himself; besides, they did not
think any Person would be so daring, as to cast
the first Stone; the then recent Instance of the
Count <i>de Wesen</i> being a sufficient Warning to
deter any Persons from entring into so dangerous
a Combination. Nevertheless there were two
Persons at Court who were not terrify'd by the
Peril, to which an Enterprize of this nature expos'd
them. The Name of both these Courtiers<!--111.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
was <i>Kamcke</i>, and being Cousins into the bargain,
they were only distinguish'd by the Appellations
of <i>Great</i> and <i>Little</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Great Kamcke</i> had been successively Page
to the King, Page of the Bed-chamber, afterwards
a declar'd Favorite, and at last Great Master of
the Wardrobe, which Post he held at the time
of the Prime Minister's Disgrace. The Favor
with which the King honor'd him, was what
made him esteem'd more than any thing else;
for setting that aside, he was not remarkable for
either the Virtues or the Vices which contribute
almost in the same measure to the forming of Great
Men. He was reckoned a Man of fine Parts,
because he was fortunate enough to gain, and to
preserve the King's Favor; and he had the Reputation
of being good-natur'd, because having
a place in which he might have done a great deal
of Mischief, he did none at all. 'Tis true too on
the other hand, that he did no body any Service;
the Lethargy of his Temperament not permitting
him to put himself upon those Motions,
which are equally necessary to serve a Friend, and
to ruin an Enemy.</p>

<p>The <i>Little Kamcke</i>, his Cousin, was of a
Temper quite different. He was not only a
Person of a piercing sparkling Wit, but had all
the Politeness of the most elegant Courtier. Being
ambitious and vain, but always with Temper;
he was cut out for those delicate Undertakings
to which the Success alone gives a Sanction; and
what is seldom to be found in so young a Man,
he had all the Management and Dissimulation necessary
for Execution. The Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>
had always hated him; for he suspected him
to have had a hand in those Ballads which <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
afterwards the King of <i>Poland</i>'s Minister, had<!--112.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
made upon the whole Court, and in which the
Count and Countess were very ill treated; but
<i>Little Kamcke</i>, who never despair'd of his Success,
still continued to make his court to the King,
without seeming to take the least Notice of the
Minister's Ill-will. His assiduous Attendance
was at length rewarded; the King begun by
granting him the Honor of playing with him
every Night at Chess; which was a Favor this
young Courtier so artfully improv'd, that in a
little time after, his Majesty made him a Minister
of State. The Count <i>de Wartemberg</i> was
mortify'd in two Respects by the Advancement
of <i>Little Kamcke</i>; for he did not expect such a
Favor to be convey'd by any Canal but himself;
and besides it was granted to a crafty Enemy,
whose rising Credit might well give him Umbrage.
<i>Kamcke</i> for his own part believing that
he was only obliged to his own Merit for his
Preferment, had even less regard for the Prime
Minister than before. They star'd upon one
another at first, without venturing to make an
Attack; but by degrees they came to high
Words; and at length <i>Kamcke</i> being puff'd up
with his Favor; and being moreover supported
by all good Men, he vow'd the Destruction of
the Prime Minister, and his Creature, the Grand
Marshal. He was so cunning as to engage his
Cousin <i>Kamcke</i> in the Scheme, because the latter
being Great Master of the Wardrobe, cou'd give
the Prime Minister the fatal Blow with more
Ease than any other Person; and he succeeded
happily; for he aggravated to his Majesty the
Complaints of the People, and the Murmurings
of the whole Court. The Queen too
being prejudic'd by the <i>Kamcke</i> spoke sharply against
the King, who at last consented to the removal<!--113.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of a Minister, whom till then he had
thought he could not be without.</p>

<p>This great Scene was open'd by the Disgrace
of the Count <i>de Witgenstein</i>, the Grand Marshal
of the Court, and the Prime Minister's Creature,
who was arrested in his House on the 27th of
<i>December</i> at 10 o'clock at Night, by a Lieutenant
of the Guards and ten Grenadiers. Next
day, about 9 in the Forenoon, M. <i>de Gersdorf</i>,
Colonel of the Regiment of Guards, accompanied
by <i>Stoffius</i>, Treasurer of the Order of the Black
Eagle, came from the King to demand his Ribban.
He presently restor'd it, assuring them that
he was wrongfully maltreated; but that nevertheless
he did not complain of the King, and
that they were only his Enemies who had impos'd
upon his Majesty's Goodness to ruin him.
Not long after an Officer of the Guards came in
and told him, that he had Orders to carry him
to <i>Spandau</i>. He made answer, that he was ready
to go wherever the King commanded him;
only he desir'd Leave to write to his Mother-in-law,
who was the Queen's Lady of Honor. The
Officer told him, that he was forbid to let him
speak or write to any Person whatsoever; and
then he took him with him into a Coach that was
attended by 12 Life-Guard Men.</p>

<p>The Noise of his Confinement being presently
spread throughout the Town, a Multitude of People
gather'd in a trice before his House, every
one crying out against the Grand Marshal, calling
him the People's Blood-sucker, and the Author
of all their Taxes. When they saw him put into
a Coach to be carried to <i>Spandau</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, their Shouts,
were doubled; but the Grand Marshal, without<!--114.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
being shock'd, let down the Glasses of his Coach,
and told the furious Rabble, that he had been a
faithful Servant to his King, and that he had
never done any thing in his Administration that
could be laid to his Charge; but the Clamours of
the People hinder'd him from being heard, and he
went out of Town, laden with Curses.</p>

<p>The Hatred that was manifested against him,
came from a Source which always touches the
People in the most sensible part; he was suspected
to have had a hand in the Creation of several
Taxes; and to have been the Projector of the
Insurance-Office from Fire. The Establishment
of this Office was very well design'd; for it undertook
to indemnify private Persons for the
Loss they might have sustain'd by Fire; and for
this purpose, every one was tax'd in a certain Sum
of Money, that there might always be a Fund
sufficient to answer the Losses by Fires. Frauds
were soon committed in the Management of the
Moneys that seem'd to be appropriated for a very
good Use; and by degrees that Establishment,
which was erected for the Relief of the People
in their extreme Necessities, serv'd only to oppress
them.</p>

<p>The Disgrace of the Grand Marshal was soon
followed by that of the Prime Minister. Two
days after the Confinement of the former, the
King ordered M. <i>d'Ilgen</i> one of his Ministers, and
principal Secretary of State, to demand the Seals
of his Prime Minister, and to order him in his
Name to have nothing more to do with the Affairs
of the Government. He receiv'd this
News with Courage, and said to the Secretary
of State, that he never had any other Will but
his Majesty's, and that therefore he was ready to
obey his Orders. The next day he received<!--115.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Orders to quit the Palace, and to retire to his
Estate at <i>Wolfersdorff</i>, a few Leagues from <i>Berlin</i>.
He immediately made ready to be gone;
but before he set out, he sent to desire the
King to give him leave to wait on him, to thank
him for all the Favors he had receiv'd at his Majesty's
hands; to which the King consented, and
the Prime Minister appear'd with an Air suitable
to the situation of his Affairs. He put every
Wile in practice that is possible to be of service
to a Minister who has had long experience of a
Court, and a perfect Knowledge of his Master's
Temper; he pray'd, he wept, but contrary to
his own Expectation and that of the whole Court,
the King continu'd stedfast, and dismiss'd him,
tho' with all the possible marks of Friendship
and Affection; for when he was going out of his
Closet the King call'd him back, and taking a
Ring of twenty thousand Crowns from his Fingers,
he gave it to him, and said that he desir'd
him to keep it as a mark of his Esteem. Thus
did the King to his regret dismiss a Person,
whom if he had pleas'd he might still have kept
in his Service.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, the moment he went from
the King, set out for <i>Wolfersdorff</i>, from whence he
wrote a very moving Letter to his Majesty to desire
him to accept of that Estate for a Present,
together with his Wife's Garden which is now
the Queen's, (they call it <i>Monbijou</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>) and all his
Porcellane Ware. The King return'd him a
very obliging Answer, and accepted of the Presents
he offer'd him, on condition however to
pay him for them; and indeed not long after
the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i> receiv'd the Value of
them. Yet notwithstanding this mark of Esteem<!--116.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
he was on the brink of being arrested;
and <i>T&mdash;&mdash;</i> who was near the King's Person at
that critical Juncture, assur'd me afterwards that
'twas <i>Little Kamcke</i> that had diverted the King
from it. The Count's Enemies had so incens'd
his Majesty against him, that the Order for his
Arrest was just ready to be dispatch'd, when
<i>Little Kamcke</i> represented to the King, that all
things duly consider'd, the Prime Minister was
not so culpable as to deserve being arrested; that
Banishment was sufficient; that however, if his
Majesty was apprehensive, that the Count knowing
the Secrets of the State would discover them
to other Powers, the only way was to secure his
Fidelity to him by a handsome Pension, on condition
however that he should never lie out of
<i>Francfort on the Main</i>, where he would be near
his Majesty's Territories and out of a Capacity to
give him any Umbrage. The King approved of
this Advice, and sent to tell the Count that he
would continue a Pension of twenty-four thousand
Crowns to him for his Life, on condition
that he would promise not to stir out of <i>Francfort</i>.
This was a very advantageous Offer, to a
Man who trembled every moment for fear of
losing his Liberty, and therefore without much
deliberation what to do, he thought of nothing
but packing up and carrying off the Wealth he
had heap'd together. When the Count and
Countess came to Court they had not wherewithal
to subsist; but they went away with Millions,
and the Countess alone had as many Diamonds
as were worth half a Million of Crowns. She
was mortally uneasy for fear of being stripp'd of
her Treasure, till she saw herself quite out of the
King's Dominions, and then her Spirits began to
rise. Upon the Road they were overtaken by<!--117.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
an Express, who brought an Order to the Count
<i>de Wartemberg</i> to deliver up the Golden Key
to the Great Chamberlain, together with the
Commission of Hereditary Post-Master; which
he obey'd instantly with very great Submission,
and afterwards continued his Journey towards
<i>Francfort</i>.</p>

<p>The King gave the Chamberlain's Key to the
<i>Great Kamcke</i>, Grand Master of his Wardrobe,
and the Office of Post-Master was executed in
Commission by <i>Little Kamcke</i>. As to the place
of Prime Minister, it was not fill'd up; and the
King, lest it should be thought that he intended
to be still govern'd as he had been all along, declar'd
he would have no more Prime Ministers.
Not long after the Count <i>de Wartemberg</i>'s Departure,
the King sent for Count <i>Christoper de
Dobna</i>, and the Count <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i>, to come to
<i>Berlin</i>. The former for some time made a Figure
very like to that of a First Minister, but had
not the Title. The Post of Grand Marshal was
supply'd by M. <i>de Printz</i>, with the Applause of
the whole Court. The Count <i>de Witgenstein</i> was
restor'd not long after to his Liberty, on paying
down a Fine to the King of fourscore thousand
Crowns. Thus, <i>Madame</i>, have you had the Catastrophe
of the two chief Favorites of our
Court.</p>

<p>I had left <i>Berlin</i> for some Months when this
great Revolution happen'd, which I heard the
first News at <i>Hanover</i>. I happen'd to be with the
Electoress when she receiv'd the Letter from the
King, that inform'd her of the Change he had
made At his Court, and of his Intention to be
for the future his own Prime Minister. For my
part I was gone from <i>Berlin</i> with a design to
travel, because of some very harsh words which<!--118.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the King said to me one day when I had fail'd
to pay my Attendance as a Gentleman of the
Bed-Chamber. The Assiduity with which I
made my Court to the Margrave <i>Philip</i> subjected
me to a very sharp Reprimand from the King.
What gave occasion to it was this, I endeavour'd
to be with the Margrave as often as possible, tho'
indeed I was not there so often as I wish'd; for
I don't think there was a Prince in the World to
whom a Man could make his Court with so much
Pleasure and Freedom. As the Margrave was
almost always at <i>Schwedt</i>, it happen'd one day
that when 'twas my turn to wait on the King, I
took it in my head to stay at the Margrave's
Court, so that a Man who happen'd to be then
going out of the Service was oblig'd to be continu'd
in it some time longer. The King asking
him the reason, the Gentleman made him Answer
that I was the cause of it, and that I had
not so much as taken care to speak to any body
to officiate for me. I arriv'd in two, or three
days, and enter'd into the Service the Week following.
The King who knew very well that my
Attachment to the Margrave his Brother was the
only cause of my Absence from my Post, ask'd
me as soon as I made my Appearance before him,
whether I serv'd his Brother or him, and why I
did not do my Duty better? I was so thunder-struck
at the manner with which the King said
these few words to me, that really I don't remember
in the least what I said for my Excuse;
but I don't forget, that whether he thought my
Plea good or bad, he made me no Answer. I
was so nettled at this Rebuke from the King in
the presence of several Persons, that I resolv'd to
be gone out of sight for a while, the better to
digest my Resentment. I therefore ask'd his<!--119.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Majesty's Leave to travel, which I easily obtain'd,
on condition however that I should not go to
<i>France</i>. For the King was then at War with
that Crown, which besides did not look upon
him in any other Light than as Elector.</p>

<p>As soon as I had obtain'd a Permission to
travel, I prepar'd to set out, but after having
taken Leave of their Majesties, I went to pass
a few days more at the Court of the Margrave
<i>Philip</i>: And the Margravine engag'd me to go
to <i>Dessau</i> to pay my Devoirs there to the Princesses
her Sisters. I had the Honor to find them
at <span class="smcap">Oranjebaum</span>, a House built by the
late Princess of <i>Orange</i>, their Mother; and 'tis
a magnificent Palace, worthy of the Princess by
whose Order it was erected. I stay'd there
eight or ten Days, and then continu'd my Journey
towards the Duchy of <i>Hanover</i>, where I
wanted to go and see my Mother, before I engag'd
farther in the great Journey that I had in
my Thoughts.</p>

<p>From <i>Oranjebaum</i> I went to<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><span class="smcap">Hall</span> in <i>Saxony</i>,
which is a City that belongs to the King,
and is a part of the Duchy of <i>Magdebourg</i>. The
Courts of Justice and the Regency of the Duchy
were formerly held in this City, but now they
are kept in the City of <i>Magdebourg</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. And
<i>Hall</i> is only remarkable for its University which
was founded in 1695, and for its excellent Salt-Works.
From <i>Hall</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Halberstadt</span>,
the Capital of a Principality of the
same Name. This City was for eight hundred
Years subject to its Bishops till it was seculariz'd
and yielded by the Treaty of <i>Westphalia</i><!--120.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
in 1648, to the Electoral Family of <i>Brandenburg</i>.
The River here is very small, for which reason
the Trade of this Town is inconsiderable; but
as it is the Seat of the Regency of the Principality,
and of the Courts of justice, 'tis much frequented.
Its Cathedral Church, which is worth
seeing, belongs to a Chapter wherein the Catholics
and the Protestants are equally admitted,
and both have the Liberty of their Public Worship.
The Catholics have several Convents in
the Town, of which that of the Recollets is the
most beautiful, and their Church is very fine.
These Fryars say they owe their Foundation to
the ancient Counts of <i>Regenstein</i>, who were heretofore
Feudataries to the House of <i>Brunswic</i>,
and whose Lands belong now to the King, notwithstanding
the very fair Pretensions of the
Dukes of <i>Brunswic</i>, and especially of the Duke
of <i>Blankenbourg</i>, Father to the Empress, to
whose share those Pretensions devolv'd. In
1709 this Prince gave a Sum of Money for new
vamping the Tomb of their Founder, which
they have done, and moreover added a <i>Latin</i>
Inscription to it in Capital Letters of Gold.
When the King went to <i>Halberstadt</i> he honor'd
this Convent with his Presence, on which occasion
the Father-Guardian preach'd before him
and gave the Sacramental Benediction, because
his Majesty had a mind to see the Ceremonies
of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>From <i>Halberstadt</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Wolfembuttle</span><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>,
which City is the common Residence
of the Dukes of <i>Brunswic</i>. Tis built
only of Timber, and has no remarkable Structure
but the Palace which is very fine, and the
Library which is worthy of the Observation of<!--121.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the Learned and the Curious, not only for the
Beauty of the Room and the regular Disposition
of the Books, but for the Number of the Printed
Volumes and Manuscripts. As soon as I arriv'd
I sent to know if I might have the Honor
of waiting on the Duke, who was then at <i>Saltzdabl</i>,
a League from <i>Wolfembuttle</i>. From this
City to the Castle the Road is lin'd with a very
fine Row of Trees. His Highness having permitted
me to pay him my Respects, I waited on
him, and was receiv'd with extraordinary Kindness.
This Prince, who was then fourscore Years
of Age, had nevertheless all the Presence of Mind
and all the Vigour of a Man of thirty. I believe
it needless to observe to you that the Person
whom I have the Honor to mention to you
was the late Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i>. This Duke
besides a superior Understanding knew many
things, which Princes are glad to abandon to
Persons of a mean Condition. If you have read
the Romance of <i>Octavia</i>, and his Translation of
several of <i>Corneille</i>'s and <i>Racine</i>'s Tragedies, you
will readily own that no Person ever wrote in
our Language more politely. This Prince was
also perfect Master of the <i>Roman</i> History, which
he had made his particular Study. He had
moreover a wonderful Taste for every thing that
was Elegant, and especially for the Liberal Arts.
One may judge of the Skill he had in Architecture
by his Castle of <i>Saltzdabl</i>, which is a
Structure not inferior in Magnificence to any
that has been rais'd by Sovereign Princes. In
this Castle, besides immensely rich Furniture,
there is a numerous but choice Collection of Pictures
that are put up in a great Gallery, which is
one of the finest Rooms in all <i>Germany</i>. The<!--122.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Duke did me the Honor after I had din'd to
carry me to it.</p>

<p>The Ducal Family of <i>Brunswic</i> was at that
time no more than the Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i>, and
his two Sons, of whom the present Duke Regent
was the eldest. Tho' this Prince has been three
times married he has had no Issue, so that the
only one of the Family that has had Children
is the Duke of <i>Blankenbourg</i>, who marry'd a
Princess of <i>Oetingen</i>, by whom he has had three
Daughters, the eldest of whom wears the Imperial
Crown, the second was marry'd to a Prince
of the <i>Czarian</i> Family, and the third to the
Prince of <i>Brunswic-Bevern</i> presumptive Heir
of the Dominions of <i>Wolfembuttle</i>.</p>

<p>The Ducal Family of <i>Brunswic</i> is intirely
<i>Lutheran</i>; yet the late Duke <i>Anthony</i> died a
Catholic, to which Religion he was converted
a little before his Death. The Enemies of his
Reputation affected to give out, that Ambition
was the motive of his entring into the Pale of
the Church, and that the Bishopric of <i>Hildesheim</i>
or the Electorate of <i>Cologne</i>, which were
both vacant at that time by the Elector's being
put under the Ban of the Empire, was the View
of his Conversion: but 'tis easy to perceive that
this Reproach is nothing but meer Calumny, if
it be consider'd, that the Duke of <i>Brunswic</i>
consider'd only in that Quality had too high a
Rank in the Empire to be flatter'd with the Episcopal
or Electoral Dignity, especially at the
Age of fourscore, and when he could not hope
for Posterity to inherit either. 'Tis very certain
that the Conversion of this Prince was the Effect
of a long Examination which he had made
of the Religion that he embrac'd, he having entertain'd
Thoughts of it for several years. When<!--123.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
he consented that his Grand-Daughter should
be married to the Emperor, it was demanded of
that Princess, that she should abjure the Religion
in which she had been educated. There
was at that time an Assembly of the ablest Divines
in <i>Germany</i>, who agreed as the <i>French</i>
Ministers did when <i>Henry</i> IV. consulted them about
his Conversion, that Salvation was to be
had in the Catholic Religion. This Confession
of the Ministers was some encouragement to the
timorous Princess, who being but young and
very tender-conscienc'd, thought there was Danger
in taking such a Step. The Duke, in order
to reconcile her thoroughly to it, promis'd her
to turn Catholic himself; and <i>Imhoff</i> his Minister
did the same. As the latter was a Man of
good Sense, and moreover of great Probity, he
had acquir'd his Master's Confidence, and as Religion
had for some time past the principal Share
in their Conversation, <i>Imhoff</i> after having weigh'd
every thing well, could not deny, that the Catholic
was the only true Religion; and he made
his Abjuration of the Protestant, some time after
the Princess. The Duke was a good while longer
before he took this Step; for tho' he was a
real Catholic in his Heart, he was willing to prepare
his Subjects for this Alteration by gentle
means; but when he receiv'd a Letter from
his Grand-Daughter, he made no longer Delay.
This Princess arriving at <i>Barcelona</i>, and hearing
that the Duke had not yet perform'd the Promise
he made to change his Religion, she wrote
a long Letter to him, wherein she let him know
how uneasy she was, for fear that the Religion
which he had advis'd her to chuse was not the
true Religion, because he was so long in embracing
it himself. Then the Duke declar'd himself,<!--124.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
and convinc'd his Grand-Daughter, that
not content with having procur'd her one of the
principal Crowns in this World, he had also done
his Endeavor to secure her another that was more
glorious and more durable.</p>

<p>After the Duke had embrac'd the Catholic
Religion, he caus'd a Church to be built at
<span class="smcap">Brunswic</span><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, which is a City but two small
Leagues from <i>Wolfembuttle</i>, thro' a very strait
Road, lin'd on both sides with Trees. When I
had taken a good View of all that was worth
seeing at <i>Saltzdabl</i>, I came to this City, which
I found did not come up near to the Notion I
had of it; nevertheless 'tis the Capital of the
Duchy of <i>Brunswic</i>. They say 'twas built <i>Anno</i>
868, by <i>Bruno</i> the Son of <i>Alphonsus</i> Duke of
<i>Saxony</i>, who call'd it after his own Name. It
was afterwards very much enlarg'd by the Emperor
<i>Henry</i> the <i>Faulconer</i>. 'Twas formerly rank'd
among the chief <i>Hanse</i> Towns, and govern'd it
self after the manner of a Republic, pretending to
be independent of its Dukes, who always oppos'd
it's Liberty Sword in hand, and 'twas not
without great difficulty that they brought it in
Subjection to them. <i>Henry</i> Duke of <i>Brunswic</i>,
surnam'd the <i>Young</i>, besieg'd it three times, but
always in vain. At length in 1617, the City
was compell'd to perform Homage to Duke <i>Frederic-Ulric</i>,
the then Regent. Nevertheless it
preserv'd its Privileges, which still gave it an
Appearance of Freedom till 1671, when <i>Rodolph
Augustus</i>, Duke of <i>Brunswic-Wolfembuttle</i>, made
himself absolute Master of it. Duke <i>Anthony-Ulric</i>
once had a Design to fortify this Place, and
the Duke his Son seem'd at first to have the same<!--125.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Intention; but afterwards he chose rather to
have noble Structures erected in it, amongst which
there's a very great Palace, where ten Sovereigns
might lodge without incommoding one another.
This Prince caus'd it to be built for the Duchess
his Wife, in case she should survive him; and
no Cost was spar'd to render it one of the richest
and most magnificent Palaces that was ever seen,
to the intent that the Charms of so fine a Habitation
might contribute in some measure to make
the Duchess more cheerful in her melancholy
State of Widowhood; which indeed could not
but be the more so to the Princess, because by
losing her Husband, she must also lose her Sovereignty;
for they had no Children, and the
Duke was too old for them ever to expect any.</p>

<p>This is the only Palace in <i>Brunswic</i> that is remarkable.
The Duke of <i>Blankenbourg</i>'s, 'tis
true, is very large, and has very fine Apartments,
but is old, and has nothing extraordinary; it
joins to the Church of St. <i>Alaise</i>, which is the
principal Church, and the Place where several of
the Dukes are buried. On the Square over-against
the Church, there's a Lion of Brass, on a
very high Pedestal, representing that which they
say was tam'd by the Duke <i>Henry</i> surnam'd the
<i>Lion</i>, to such a degree, that the terrible Animal
follow'd him wherever he went; and even after
the Duke's Death and Interment in the Church
of St. <i>Alaise</i>, the Lion went towards the Church
Door, try'd to break it open, stay'd there in
spite of all the Attempts to take him off, and
died on the very Spot, for Grief that he had lost
his Master.</p>

<p>I afterwards went to <span class="smcap">Zell</span><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, and from thence<!--126.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
to <span class="smcap">Hanover</span>. The first of these Towns is
small, and has nothing remarkable. It was formerly
the common Residence of the Dukes of
<i>Zell</i>, who had a very commodious Castle in it;
but since that Country devolv'd by Inheritance
to the House of <i>Hanover</i>, there's nothing remaining
here but the Courts of Justice and the
Regency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanover</span><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is the Capital of the Electorate,
and the Seat of the Electors. This Court was
always one of the politest in <i>Germany</i>, especially
during the Life of the late Princess <i>Sophia</i>, the
Electoress Dowager and Mother. This August
Princess, who was descended from the most illustrious
Blood in <i>Europe</i>, was the Daughter of
the unhappy <i>Frederic</i>, the Elector <i>Palatine</i>, and of
the Princess of <i>England</i>, Daughter of K. <i>James</i> I.
by whom the Right of Succession to the Crown
of <i>England</i> devolv'd to the House of <i>Hanover</i>.
This Princess, tho' she was full Fourscore when
I was at <i>Hanover</i>, labour'd under none of those
Infirmities, which one would think to be inseparable
from so great an Age: She was really a
Prodigy for Vivacity and Memory; she spoke
<i>French</i>, <i>English</i> and <i>Italian</i> as well as her Mother-Tongue,
and had moreover a wonderful
just way of Thinking, which she had taken the
pains to cultivate by great Reading. This Princess
had been the Mother of several Children,
of whom there were then but three Princes surviving,
<i>viz.</i> the eldest, who was then the Elector,
and afterwards King of <i>Great Britain</i>; the
second whose Name was Duke <i>Maximilian</i>; and<!--127.png--><span class="pagenum">121</span>
the third the Duke <i>Ernest Augustus</i>, afterwards
Bishop of <i>Osnabrug</i> and Duke of <i>York</i>.</p>

<p>Of the Electoress's three Sons, none but the
Elector had any Children; and these are the Electoral
Prince, now King of <i>England</i>, and the
Princess Royal, now our Queen.</p>

<p>The Electoral Prince's Family was more numerous.
He has had a Son and several Daughters
by the Princess of <i>Brandenburg-Anspach</i>. I
had the Honor of waiting on the Princes and
Princesses the very next day after my Arrival,
and was received very graciously, especially by
the Electoress Mother, who all the Time that I
staid at Court, honor'd me with her special
Protection.</p>

<p>I spent all the <i>Carnival</i> time at this Court,
where 'twas open'd on the 2d day of <i>January</i> by
a <i>French</i> Comedy, after which there was Play and
a Drawing-Room at the Electoress's Apartment
till ten o'clock at Night. Next day there was
a Ridotto in imitation of that of <i>Venice</i>, that is
to say, a public Ball, to which every body was
admitted that had a Mask, but not with Arms.
This Ball was held at the Town-House, every
other day during the whole <i>Carnival</i>. In the
same Room where the Ridotto was perform'd,
they play'd at <i>Ombre</i> and <i>Picquet</i>, and in another
at <i>Basset</i>; there was a third Room in which the
Tables were cover'd with a cold Treat; and
next to this third Room there was a fourth, in
which were distributed Coffee, Chocolate, Liquors,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I had a very great Share in all the Diversions
of the <i>Carnival</i>, being then at an Age when nothing
is so much minded as Pleasures; especially
when a Person has Money enough to keep
him from the Uneasiness, which is the necessary<!--128.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
consequence of the want of that precious Metal.
Of this I was now furnish'd with a handsome
Stock, and therewith cut a very gay Figure;
but was soon oblig'd to lessen my Expences, because
nothing would serve me but I must try a
fatal Experiment, in which I was bit. I had a
mind to try Fortune at Gaming; and play'd at
first with pretty good Luck; but afterwards the
Chance turn'd, and I was soon in a very great
Quandary what to do with my Person, being neither
able to proceed in my Journey, nor return
from whence I came; and much less to stay at
<i>Hanover</i>, where I had always made some Figure.
I then did what young Fellows us'd to do in
such a Situation; that is to say, made several
Bargains, but none to my Advantage. At last
I was oblig'd to expose my Circumstances to my
Mother, who was still my Guardian. I had
much ado to get the Money of her that I wanted;
but I wrote such moving Letters to her,
that she was sensible at last that she was my Mother,
and after having made me wait a little
while, she was so good as to send me the necessary
Sums.</p>

<p>This little Disorder in my Affairs happen'd at
a very unseasonable Time: for the Electoress
had been so kind as to get a Passport for me to
go to <i>Paris</i>, by means of the late Madame of
<i>France</i>; but as the same was only granted for
two Months, 'twas impossible for me to make
use of it, having been oblig'd to spend almost all
that time in contriving Expedients to retrieve my
Finances.</p>

<p>The Money that my Mother was so kind as to
send me, put me again into a Condition of travelling.
The Emperor <i>Joseph</i>'s Death happening
at that time, I resolv'd to go and see the Election<!--129.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of a new Emperor. This great Prince died
at <i>Vienna</i>, the 17th of <i>May</i>, at 32 years of Age and
nine Months. He left the Imperial Throne vacant,
but his other Crowns devolv'd by Hereditary
Right to his Brother. As soon as that Emperor
died, the Empress Mother assum'd the
Government of his Hereditary Kingdoms and
Dominions, in the Absence of the King her Son,
to whom she sent an Express to carry the News,
as she did also to each of the Electors. The
<i>Saxon</i> and <i>Palatine</i> Electors, as Vicars of the
Empire, took Care of the Government of it
during the Inter-regnum; and the Elector of
<i>Mentz</i>, as Great Chancellor of the Empire,
wrote circular Letters (which are call'd Letters of
<i>Intimation</i>) to invite the Electors to the Assembly
that was to be at <i>Francfort</i> for the ensuing
Election.</p>

<p>As this Assembly was not to be till <i>August</i>,
I went in the mean while to <i>Holland</i>. The first
Town I pass'd thro' after I left <i>Hanover</i>, was
<span class="smcap">Minden</span>, which is a Town upon the <i>Weser</i>,
encompass'd with Walls, and defended by some
Half-Moons, which nevertheless don't hinder
one's seeing every thing that passes in the Square
from a Hill that commands the Town, and from
whence 'tis an easy matter to beat it to the ground.
'Twas formerly a Hanse Town, being a part of
<i>Westphalia</i>, and had always the Title of a Bishopric,
till the Treaty of <i>Munster</i>, when it was
seculariz'd, and given to the Family of <i>Brandenburg</i>,
who settled a Regency here. It always
retain'd two Chapters, one of Canons, and the
other of Canonesses, into which the Ladies must
make proof of their Nobility to be admitted.
The famous Count <i>Tilly</i>, General of the Imperial
Troops, when he was pursuing <i>Maurice</i> the<!--130.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Landgrave of <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>, attack'd and took this
Place in 1626, when the General, exasperated
with the Town, which tho' extremely weak, refused
to comply with the very advantagious Terms
that he offer'd it, took it by Storm, and put
near 3000 Men, Soldiers and Inhabitants, to the
Sword.</p>

<p>As I proceeded, I passed thro' <span class="smcap">Hervorden</span>,
which is an ill-built Town, in the County of
<i>Ravensberg</i>. 'Tis an Imperial Town, and yet
the King maintains a Garison in it. There's a Chapter
of Ladies, the Abbess of which is a Native
Princess of the Empire; and indeed this is what
the Town is most remarkable for, it being otherwise
not very considerable any more than the
Towns of <span class="smcap">Lipstadt</span> and <span class="smcap">Ham</span>. These belong
both to the King, of which the first is fortify'd,
and Justice is therein administer'd, in the Name
of the King and the Count <i>de la Lippe</i>, who has
half of the Revenue. Every thing relating to
the Fortifications or the Garison, is the King's.
The Baron <i>de Heiden</i>, General of the Horse, was
Governor of it when I was there.</p>

<p>After having left these two Places, there is
no considerable Town till we come to <span class="smcap">Wesel</span>,
which stands upon the <i>Rhine</i>, and is a part of
the Duchy of <i>Cleves</i>. 'Tis now one of the
strongest Places in <i>Europe</i>; for the King, who
was about fortifying it when I was there, ordered
that no Cost should be spar'd to carry the
Works to the utmost Perfection. The Person
he employ'd to direct them was M. <i>Bot</i> a <i>Frenchman</i>,
and Governor of the Place, one of the
ablest Engineers now living. When I had
rested a few days at <i>Wesel</i> I fell down the <i>Rhine</i>
to <i>Nimeguen</i>, and by the way saw <span class="smcap">Emmerick</span>
and <span class="smcap">Schenk</span>. <i>Emmerick</i> is a Hanse Town upon<!--131.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the <i>Rhine</i>, which was taken by the <i>French</i> in
1652, and restor'd two years after to the Elector
of <i>Brandenburg</i>. <i>Schenk</i>, which is the first place
in <i>Holland</i>, stands at the Point where the <i>Rhine</i>
divides it self into two Branches, one of which
is call'd <i>Vahal</i>, and the other retains the Name
of the <i>Rhine</i>. This Place was built in 1586,
by <i>Martin Schenk</i> a <i>Gueldrian</i>, from whom it
took the Name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nimeguen</span><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> is built upon a Hill which rises
by degrees to the very Centre of the Place, and
is part of the Province of <i>Guelderland</i>. This
Town is famous for having been taken and re-taken
in the War the <i>Dutch</i> carry'd on with
<i>Spain</i> for preserving their Liberty. That Crown
was oblig'd at last to yield it to the <i>Dutch</i>, from
whom <i>Lewis</i> XIV. took it in 1672; but it was
restor'd to them soon after. 'Twas in this Place
that the Peace was concluded between <i>France</i>
and the Allies in 1678. At the beginning of
the War for the <i>Spanish</i> Succession, the Duke
of <i>Burgundy</i> endeavor'd to make himself Master
of it, but he had not the Fortune to succeed.
The <i>Dutch</i> have made it very strong, it being
their main Bulwark towards the Duchy of <i>Cleves</i>.
To go by Land from <i>Nimeguen</i> to <span class="smcap">Utrecht</span>,
I cross'd the <i>Vahal</i> over a Flying-Bridge. I
shall not speak of this City now; for I did not
stay there, but went strait to <span class="smcap">Leyden</span><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, a City
in the Province of <i>Holland</i>, famous for its University,
founded in 1575.</p>

<p>This is without dispute one of the finest Cities
in all the United Provinces. 'Tis situate in
the ancient Channel of the <i>Rhine</i>. The Streets
which are broad and very long, are extremely<!--132.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
neat, and are for the most part divided by Canals,
that are of a great Conveniency to its
Trade, which consists chiefly in Woollen Cloth,
whereof the City of <i>Leyden</i> makes more than
any other Town in <i>Holland</i>. There's a Library
also in this City, which is a very good Collection
of the most curious printed Volumes, and
a great Number of very scarce old MSS. Here
is likewise a Physic-Garden worth seeing, and especially
a Hall for Anatomies, in which there
is all manner of Curiosities. This City sustain'd
a Siege by the <i>Spaniards</i> in 1574, when the
<i>Dutch</i> shook off their Tyrants Yoke. During
this the City was reduc'd to the last Extremity,
the Siege having continu'd from <i>Easter</i> to the 3d
of <i>October</i>, when the <i>Spaniards</i> were oblig'd to
retire. Tho' <i>Leyden</i> is a very pretty City, yet I
take it to be one of the dullest Places in all <i>Holland</i>
to live in; for go where one will, we meet
with such sickly Countenances as makes one melancholy
to see them: not but that the Town's-People
are as healthy here as elsewhere; only
the Habit they have got of appearing always in
their Night-Gowns, and of even walking the
Streets in them, makes them look more like Valetudinarians,
than People in Health.</p>

<p>After a few days stay at <i>Leyden</i>, I went to the
<span class="smcap">Hague</span><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, which I think may well be call'd the
principal Village of <i>Europe</i>, it having neither
Walls nor Ramparts; but bating that, 'tis one of
the pleasantest Places in all <i>Holland</i>; it being so
delightful that the States-General have chose it,
preferably to any other, for holding their Assemblies;
and here also reside the Ministers of the
Foreign Courts. There is not a Place in all<!--133.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
<i>Holland</i> that yields such fine Walks, and the
People are polite and much more sociable than
in any other part of the Country. Most of the
People of Quality meet every Evening alternately
at one another's Houses: These Assemblies
would be much finer than they are in general, if
the Company was not so promiscuous; but the
Freedom of the Country, and the Wealth of the
Inhabitants, very often set the Burgher upon a
Level with the Man of Quality, and sometimes
too above him.</p>

<p>The Houses at the <i>Hague</i> are very fine, yet
they are all without the Rules of Architecture,
without Ornament, and in a manner without
Regularity, excepting the Palaces of the Old
Court and of Prince <i>Maurice</i>, and the House of
M. <i>Obdam</i>. There's not a House in short that
has the air of a great Man's House; the inner
Rooms are commonly very mean, and not very
commodious; they have no Notion of Anti-Chambers;
the Domestics pass their Time in
the Kitchens or the Entries; and, except at the
Houses of Ambassadors, what we call a <i>Swiss</i>
or Porter, is no where to be seen. There's a
great Number of <i>Jews</i> at the <i>Hague</i>, who make
a fine Figure, especially the <i>Portuguese Jews</i>.
These Gentlemen have the Equipages of Ambassadors,
with magnificent Houses and Gardens;
and they often make Treats with the utmost
Delicacy and Splendor. They are admitted into
all Companies, and only differ from the Christians
of this Country by being possess'd of
much more Wealth, and living at a far greater
Expence. I knew one of 'em whose Name was
<i>Duliz</i>, that was very much esteem'd: He was
good-natur'd, generous, extremely charitable, and
reliev'd all indifferently that were Objects of<!--134.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Compassion, without giving himself the Trouble
of enquiring whether the Sharers of his Bounty
were <i>Jews</i> or <i>Christians</i>: And to my own knowledge
he contributed as freely for the Maintenance
of a Church, as if it had been his own Synagogue.</p>

<p>When I had staid about a Month at the
<i>Hague</i>, I set out to see the chief Towns of <i>Holland</i>.
The two first that one comes to are <span class="smcap">Delft</span>
and <i>Rotterdam</i>. <i>Delft</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> is a League from the
<i>Hague</i>. They say that this Town was built by
<i>Godfrey</i> the <i>Crooked</i> when he had conquer'd this
Country; and that <i>Albert</i> of <i>Bavaria</i> having
made himself master of it, demolish'd its Walls
and Castle. It was entirely burnt to the ground
by Accident in 1536, and afterwards re-built.
The like Misfortune happen'd to it again in 1654,
when the Powder Magazine took fire, and the
Town, tho' not totally consum'd, was nevertheless
very much damag'd. It was again entirely
re-built in the general Taste of all the Towns of
<i>Holland</i>, that is to say, with Canals. There are
two fine Churches at <i>Delft</i>, in the Chief of
which there is the Tomb of Prince <i>William</i> of
<i>Orange</i>, who was assassinated in this Town in
1584, by <i>Belthazar Gerard</i>, a Native of <i>Franche-Comte</i>;
and in the other Church there is the
Tomb of the famous <i>Dutch</i> Admiral <i>Martin
Trompe</i>, which is of Marble, with a very fine Inscription,
and beautiful Basso-Relievo's, which represent
the principal Actions of that great Man.
'Twas in this Town, that the Plenipotentiaries of
<i>France</i> resided during the Congress of <i>Ryswic</i>.
All Ambassadors are receiv'd here on the part of
the States, and 'tis here that they begin their<!--135.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
March for their public Entry at the <i>Hague</i>. The
Road which leads to it is lin'd with Elms, and
entirely pav'd with Brick. There is not a
Place in all <i>Holland</i> where so many Passage-Boats
are continually coming and going. They set out
every Half-hour for the <i>Hague</i>, and every Hour
for <i>Rotterdam</i>. These Boats are the favorite Carriers
of the Country; and they are the most convenient
Passage, not only for the Regularity of
their Departure and Arrival, but because the Fare
is settled. I forgot to tell you, that <i>Delft</i> is the
Place where they make the fine Earthen Ware.</p>

<p>From <i>Delft</i> I went and lay at <span class="smcap">Rotterdam</span><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
This City, which stands upon the <i>Maese</i>,
is second to <i>Amsterdam</i> for Trade, notwithstanding
the Difficulty of entring the <i>Maese</i>, at the
Mouth of which River Ships are oblig'd to stay
for the Tide, and for a Pilot that knows the Coast.
They say that <i>Rotterdam</i> derives its Origin from
<i>Ruther</i> King of the <i>Franks</i>. This City is large and
well built; and by its several Canals has a convenient
Communication with all the Towns of
<i>Holland</i>. The only Monument at <i>Rotterdam</i> is
a Statue of Brass in the great Square, representing
the famous <i>Erasmus</i>, to whom this City gave
Birth.</p>

<p>From <i>Rotterdam</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Dort</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Dordrecht</span>, which is a very ancient Town,
and the first in Rank in the Dominions of <i>Holland</i>.
It stands in an Island between the <i>Maese</i>, the
<i>Merwe</i>, the <i>Rhine</i>, and the <i>Ling</i>, having been
broke off from the main Land in 1421, by an
Inundation, which laid almost all its Territory
under Water, and drown'd about 100,000 Persons.
All these Rivers form a kind of Sea; so<!--136.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
that at a distance the Situation of this Town
looks very much like that of <i>Venice</i>. This Place
was anciently the Residence of the Counts of
<i>Holland</i>, one of whom, <i>viz.</i> <i>Albert</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>,
founded a Collegiate Church here in 1363. The
Protestants assembled that famous National Synod
here in 1618, which did not separate till the
year following, after having establish'd that Religion
which prevails at this time in the United
Provinces.</p>

<p>When I had staid at <i>Dort</i> as long as was necessary
to see the Town and Parts adjacent, I return'd
to <i>Rotterdam</i>, from whence I went next
day in a Boat for <span class="smcap">Amsterdam</span><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. This is the
most famous City in all <i>Holland</i>, its Extent, vast
Trade and Riches being the Admiration of all
Foreigners; and what is more surprizing is, that
it owes its Aggrandizement to itself, and its great
Wealth to its Commerce. 'Tis said that this
City was not known before the Year 1204; and
that then it was no more than a little Castle
call'd <i>Amstel</i>, from the Name of the River on
which it was built. The then Lord of it, <i>Gysbrecht
van Amstel</i> brought Inhabitants to it, who
were for most part poor Cottagers, that carried
on a small Trade with their Neighbours by means
of their Fishery; and at last by the force of Industry
throve so well, that <i>Amstel</i> from a Village,
became in a few years, a very considerable Town,
which was always subject to its own Lords, till
a second <i>Gysbrecht</i> being concern'd in the Assassination
of <i>Florence</i> V. Count of <i>Holland</i>, was
oblig'd for some time to get out of the way,
which prov'd to the Detriment of <i>Amsterdam</i>;
but <i>Gysbrecht</i> returning at length began to<!--137.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
build Bridges and Towers, as he did several
Houses at the same time in the neighbouring
Country; and then they began to call the Place
<i>Amsteldam</i>, by the Addition of the Word <i>Dam</i>,
i. e. a <i>Dyke</i>, to its former Name of <i>Amstel</i>. This
little Town was united afterwards to the County
of <i>Holland</i>. <i>William</i> IV. Sovereign of the Country,
gave it several Privileges in 1342. These
<i>Albert</i> of <i>Bavaria</i> confirm'd afterwards, by giving
the Inhabitants a Power also of enlarging
the Town, which by its Situation, and the Industry
of the Inhabitants to improve its Commerce,
soon became considerable; yet it continued
without any Walls, even so long as the
Year 1482. In the 16th Century this City increas'd
considerably in Power; and during the
Troubles which arose on account of Religion,
took great Care to preserve the Catholic Religion,
and their due Allegiance to its Princes. It
turn'd out the Ministers of the Reformed Religion,
and all that had embrac'd that Doctrine several
times. But at length finding its Trade
decay; and that the Succours brought to it by
the Duke of <i>Alva</i>, Governor of the <i>Netherlands</i>,
were scatter'd, 'twas oblig'd to surrender to the
Prince of <i>Orange</i> in 1587, on condition nevertheless
that the Catholics should not be molested.
This indeed was promis'd, but not duly
perform'd; for the Clergy and Friars were soon
after expell'd, and the Altars demolish'd; the
consequence of which was the putting an entire
stop to all the public Exercise of the Catholic
Religion. The War which the Inhabitants of
<i>Amsterdam</i> had upon their hands, and the Persecution
of the Catholics had hurt its Trade very
much, till the Civil Wars kindled in the neighbouring
Provinces drove several Merchants<!--138.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
from <i>Brussels</i>, <i>Antwerp</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> to <i>Amsterdam</i>, where
these new Citizens contributed so much to the
Revival of its Commerce, that they have render'd
it one of the finest and richest Cities in Being;
and 'tis commonly call'd, <i>The Warehouse of
the World</i>.</p>

<p>If the Situation of <i>Amsterdam</i> be duly considered,
it may be said to be one of the Wonders of
the World. It stands so low, that it wou'd be
continually in danger of being drown'd, were
not the Water kept out by Dykes as high as the
Waves. The River <i>Amstel</i>, so gentle that one
can hardly perceive which way it runs, passes
thro' the whole City, and forms the great Canal
over which there are two Bridges. That which
is at the Mouth of the Sea, call'd the <i>Pont-neuf</i>,
is one of the finest of the kind, not only for its
Sluices, but for the noble View there is from
thence of the Harbor, where Ships are continually
going out or coming in from all parts of the
World. Besides the Great Canal, there are
others which deserve to be taken notice of, as,
<i>The Emperors</i> Canal, <i>The Lords</i> Canal; that of
the <i>Cingle</i>, and the <i>Princes</i> Canal: All these Canals
are broad and deep, and furnish'd with great
Kays. The Sides are fac'd with Free-stone or
Brick, and adorn'd with Lime-Trees and Elms.
Very fine Houses are built on most of these
Kays, and especially upon the Kay of <i>The
Lords</i> Canal; and new ones are building every
day, which are very beautiful; and tho'
they are small, and not in the Rules of Architecture,
have a certain Air of Neatness which is
to be found no where else. Almost all the
Houses have very fine Steps of shining black
Marble, and noble Window-Frames, with very
fine Panes, which are often of polish'd Glass.<!--139.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>The Streets of <i>Amsterdam</i> are generally pretty
narrow, yet very fine and neat; and on certain
Days of the Week great Care is taken to wash
them. I must tell you by the way, that there
is not a place where the People are so fond of
washing as they are at <i>Amsterdam</i>; for they scour
the inside of their Houses every Week without
fail, together with the Furniture of the Kitchen;
so that they are always in the Suds. 'Tis true, that
without this Care every thing would grow mouldy
and spoil, as Foreigners have very often experienc'd,
who, how loth soever to comply with
this sort of Slavery, which they thought only
the Fashion of the Country, were soon oblig'd
to submit to it: And I believe, that were it not
for this Necessity of always washing, the <i>Dutch</i>
wou'd not lose so much Time about it; for in
other respects I have not observ'd 'em so nice.
These People wear a Shirt for a Fortnight very
well under a nasty, greasy Woollen Waistcoat:
and their manner of eating is as slovenly; for
the Generality know no Forks but their Fingers,
wherewith they scoop up the Sallad swimming
in the Vinegar, which is commonly their
favorite Dish<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>Of all the Public Buildings at <i>Amsterdam</i>, the
Stadt-house is certainly the most magnificent.
'Tis a great Pile built of Free-stones very finely
set, and forms a long Square. The 7 Porticoes
which are in the main Front, and which the Architect
has reduc'd to the number of 7, to denote
the 7 United Provinces, are look'd upon as a
defect in Architecture; for they are so narrow,
that three Persons can scarce walk a-breast in
them: which indeed is contrary to the Rules of<!--140.png--><span class="pagenum">134</span>
Architecture, but yet no Fault in a Building,
which like the Stadt-house is frequently expos'd
to the Rage and Riots of a People as turbulent
as the <i>Amsterdamers</i>. These seven Porticoes lead
to two Gates at the Foot of the Grand Stair-Case.
I don't pretend, <i>Madame</i>, to give you all the
particular Beauties of this Structure, being not
acquainted enough with the Rules, or even the
Terms of Architecture, to presume to enter into
any Description of this nature; therefore I shall
confine my self to what most strikes the Eye.</p>

<p>The Pediment of the principal Front was to
my mind well fancy'd. 'Tis adorn'd with a Relievo
of white Marble, in which a Woman is represented
supporting the Arms of the City.
There is also a <i>Neptune</i>, some Figures of Heroes,
Lions, Unicorns, and the whole is of admirable
Workmanship. This Pediment is crown'd with
three fine Statues of Brass, which denote Justice,
Power and Plenty. On the very Top of this
whole Building there's a Tower in form of a
Dome. Here is a very fine Clock with Chimes,
which are a pretty Amusement for such as are
fond of that sort of Music.</p>

<p>The Inside of this House is every part of it
very magnificent. The Chamber where they
pass Sentence on Criminals is lin'd throughout
with Marble, and adorn'd with Basso-Relievo's,
representing all the Emblems and Attributes of
Justice. That which is most admir'd there is a
fine Marble Statue representing <i>Themis</i>. This
Room is rais'd very high, and a little too dark;
yet 'tis so contriv'd, that all the People in the
Square may see the Criminals try'd. The three
Porticoes at the Entrance answer to the three
Windows of this Hall, which Windows instead<!--141.png--><span class="pagenum">135</span>
of Glass, have noble Bars of Brass curiously
wrought.</p>

<p>The Great Hall is another stately Room, to
which there's an Ascent by a large Stair-Case
with two Flights. All the Walls are lin'd with
Basso-Relievo's of Marble, intermix'd with fine
Paintings. There are two Galleries or Corridors
at the two ends of the Hall, which lead to Apartments
on the right and left. In these Chambers
are kept the several Offices relating to Affairs
of the City. The Jurisdiction or Province
of each Chamber is inscrib'd over the Door;
and the Affairs there treated, are represented in
magnificent Basso-Relievo's. In one of these
Rooms, such Persons as are not of the Reform'd
Religion are oblig'd to be married before the
<i>Echevin</i>, or else they are condemn'd in a Fine;
and according to the Laws, their Marriage is to
be reckon'd null and void.</p>

<p>In the Town-House is kept the famous Bank,
which is the Repository of such a vast Treasure.
Prodigious Arches and huge double Bars of Iron
before the Windows, render it inaccessible. The
Vaults are admirable, being built upon Piles in
the middle of the Water, and yet so dry as if
they were cut out of a Rock. One part of these
Vaults serves for containing the immense Wealth,
the other for confining Criminals. I had the
Curiosity to go and see those Dungeons, which
are all very lightsome and kept very neat; and in
spite of the Proverb, they may be said to be very
fine Prisons.</p>

<p>After I had been at the Town-House, I went
to visit the Square where the Merchants assemble
about the Affairs of their Trade from Noon till
half an Hour past one o'clock. This Square,
which is longer than 'tis broad, is surrounded<!--142.png--><span class="pagenum">136</span>
with a large open Gallery or Corridor, supported
by Free-stone Pillars, for shelter in case of Rain;
and is call'd the <i>Bourse</i> or <i>Exchange</i>. Here are
Merchants of all Nations, the diversity of whose
Habits and Languages is as pleasing as the Beauty
of the Place; and especially the Hurry those
People are in that are call'd <i>Brokers</i>, who are the
Men employ'd by the great Merchants to traffick
the Bills of Exchange, or to transact their other
Affairs. To see them scowering from one to the
other all about this Square, there's no body but
wou'd think they were mad.</p>

<p>The <i>India</i>-House and Admiralty-Office are
also worth seeing. The first serves as a Warehouse
for laying up such Merchandize as comes
from the <i>Indies</i>. In the latter there is all the necessary
Rigging for fitting out a Fleet to Sea.
The <i>India</i> Company have their separate Arsenal,
which is in nothing inferior to that of the
States. In this City there are Hospitals also of
every Kind very well maintain'd, and Houses of
Correction for both Sexes. <i>Amsterdam</i> is the
Place of Refuge for Sects of all Denominations,
who have their several Chappels or Chambers
there, wherein they exercise their Religion, but
the <i>Calvinists</i> and <i>Lutherans</i> only are allow'd the
Liberty of Public Worship. However the <i>Jews</i>
have two fine Synagogues here; the one for the
<i>German</i>, and the other for the <i>Portuguese</i> Nation.
Of this Sect there are great Numbers, and they
live in a particular Quarter, which is not the most
inconsiderable of the City.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all this Magnificence of
Buildings, and the Concourse of so many Nations,
I was quite out of conceit with <i>Amsterdam</i>.
Every body sticks to Trade, and the Gratification
of their Avarice is their whole Study. The<!--143.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Generality with their immense Wealth live like
Misers; and all their Happiness, their Pleasure
and their Pride consists in having a great deal of
Money: They think of nothing but how to
acquire Riches; and they look upon every
Man that lives genteelly as a Prodigal. As to
the <i>Dutch</i> Freedom, I don't believe there's a
Place where it bears greater Sway than at <i>Amsterdam</i>.
'Tis true, that this so much boasted
Liberty serves very often but to render the Citizens
insolent with Impunity; for there is not
a Scrub but thinks himself as good a Man as the
best in the Country: Foreigners have sometimes
much ado to bear it, they being often abus'd
without daring to complain; for it costs so much
to obtain Justice here, that People had rather
put up with an Insult, than seek a Remedy by
due Course of Law. The Attorneys and Solicitors
of this City outdo those of all other Countries
in flattering their Clients to their Ruin, and
most of this Gentry cut a great Figure, have
noble Houses and Gardens, and some too have
very spruce Equipages.</p>

<p>From <i>Amsterdam</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Harlem</span><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, which
is but three Leagues. Heretofore, while the Catholic
Religion subsisted in this Country, it was
a Bishopric, Suffragan of <i>Utrecht</i>. The Town
stands but a League from the Sea, or rather upon
its Shore, the Sea having overflow'd a considerable
part of the Country, which forms a
Lake, now call'd the <i>Harlem Meer</i>, or Sea of
<i>Harlem</i>. This Town communicates by its
Canals both with <i>Amsterdam</i> and <i>Leyden</i>. They
pretend it was founded by the <i>Normans</i> in the
ninth Century. Pope <i>Paul</i> IV. erected it into a<!--144.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Bishopric in 1559, at the Request of <i>Philip</i> II.
King of <i>Spain</i>. In 1572 the Bishop was turn'd
out by the Protestants, not long after which the
Town was besieg'd and taken by <i>Frederic</i> of
<i>Toledo</i> Son to the Duke of <i>Alva</i>, who oblig'd the
Inhabitants to surrender at Discretion, and caus'd
them to be treated in the most barbarous manner
in the World. The <i>Dutch</i> retook it afterwards,
and have held it ever since. There are very fine
Walks in this City, and especially a Grove which
is deem'd a charming Place by the Citizens of
<i>Amsterdam</i>, who come hither in the Summer to
make their Parties of Pleasure.</p>

<p>After having seen what was most remarkable
at <i>Harlem</i>, I return'd by the way of <i>Leyden</i> to
the <i>Hague</i>, where I had not been many days,
before the King arriv'd, having pass'd the same
day before <i>Rotterdam</i>, where he had been saluted
with a triple Discharge of the Cannon, as
he was also at <i>Delfshaven</i>, where he found his
Yatcht, follow'd by several others that had been
sent to him from the <i>Hague</i>. These attended
the King to <i>Delft</i>, where his Coaches staid for
him, with which he came to his Palace of the
<i>Old Court</i>.</p>

<p>There he found a Guard of fourscore Men,
with a Captain and a Pair of Colors. His Majesty
caus'd his Arrival to be immediately notify'd to
the President of the Assembly of the States-General,
and next day, after Sermon time, he receiv'd
the Deputation from the said States,
consisting of nine Members, who when they
arriv'd at the King's Palace found the Guard
under Arms, Colors flying, and the Drum beating,
and were receiv'd at the bottom of the
Stairs by the Grand Marshal and several Gentlemen
of the Chamber, and introduc'd into the<!--145.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
King's Bed-chamber, who receiv'd them bare-headed
and standing before an Arm-Chair. As
the Audience was only to compliment his Majesty
upon his Arrival, it was very short; and the
States returning to the usual Place of their Assembly,
went afterwards and din'd with the King.</p>

<p>Some days after this his Majesty set out for
<i>Honslaerdyk</i>, a Place two Leagues from the <i>Hague</i>,
which he enjoy'd by Inheritance from the late K.
<i>William</i> of <i>England</i>. Thither I follow'd the
King, who staid there till he had receiv'd Advice,
that the Prince of <i>Nassau</i>, Governor of
<i>Friseland</i>, was to come from the Army in <i>Flanders</i>
to the <i>Hague</i>, there to make an end of
the Differences betwixt him and his Majesty about
the Succession to the Family of <i>Orange</i>,
of which that Prince took the Title, by virtue of
the last Will and Testament of the late King of
<i>England</i>, the last Prince of the said Family. The
King had been expecting him for some days,
when a Courier arriv'd with the News, that the
Prince was drown'd in the Passage of the <i>Moerdyke</i>.
Having embark'd there with his Retinue
to pass the <i>Stryen-Sas</i>, he was not got above
thirty or forty Paces from Shore, when a furious
Gust of Wind arose, by which the Vessel
was overset and lost. As the Sea swell'd at the
same time, and the Prince knew not how to
swim, he could not get ashore. Colonel <i>Hilkes</i>
who accompanied him was drown'd with him,
and none but his Domestics escap'd. The unfortunate
Prince was seen to hang by the Mast
of the Vessel for some Moments, and there were
some hopes of relieving him, had it not been
for a Wave, which drove by a Blast of Wind
carried him off from the piece of Wood he clung
to, and cast him away. The Body of this Prince,<!--146.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
who was very much regretted, was not found till
about a Week after, in the very same place where
the Vessel happen'd to be cast away. 'Twas carried
to <i>Dort</i> where 'twas embalm'd, and then remov'd
to <i>Lewarden</i>, there to be interr'd in the
Tomb of his Family.</p>

<p>The King was the more afflicted at this sad
Accident, because the News was told him too
hastily, by a foolish Courier, who, for want of
knowing his Master's Temper, thought that the
News of the Prince of <i>Friseland</i>'s Death wou'd
not be disagreeable to him; but the King gave
public Demonstration how sorry he was for his
Loss, and sent a Gentleman of the Bed-chamber
to the last Princess-Dowager of <i>Nassau</i>, to assure
her how much he sympathiz'd in her loss.</p>

<p>The Death of the Prince of <i>Friseland</i> interrupted
the whole Treaty of Accommodation.
The said Prince left a Daughter, and the Princess
his Wife pregnant, who wrote to the States
to desire them not to do any thing in prejudice
of the Infant of whom she hoped to be deliver'd;
and that as they were Executors Testamentary,
they would preserve the Bulk of his Inheritance
entire; and that otherwise she openly protested
against every thing that might be done. This
Demand did not hinder the States from granting
the King a provisional Portion; and it was agreed,
that his Majesty, as well as the Heirs of the Prince
of <i>Nassau</i>, now deceas'd, should be paid 150000
<i>Dutch</i> Florins a year, out of the Estate of the
<i>Orange</i> Family: That the Palaces of Prince
<i>Frederic-Henry</i>, of which the King was already
in Possession, shou'd continue his; but that the
<i>Dieren</i> Palace shou'd be common both to the
King and the Prince's Heirs; and that the rest
should be referr'd to a definitive Accommodation,<!--147.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
which is the Thing that still remains to be done.
I had the Honor to pay my Court punctually
all the Time that his Majesty spent at the <i>Hague</i>;
and when he set out, I went with him to <i>Dieren</i>,
where I took leave of the King, little thinking
'twou'd be the last Time I should see him.</p>

<p>I went thro' <span class="smcap">Dusseldorff</span><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, the Capital of
the Duchy of <i>Berg</i>, which was then the Residence
of the Elector <i>Palatine</i>, who, it must be
noted, was the first of the <i>Palatine</i> Electors that
liv'd here; for the Electors commonly resided
heretofore at <i>Heidelberg</i> or <i>Manheim</i>. The Elector
<i>John-William</i> had preferred <i>Dusseldorff</i> to
all other Places, from an early liking that he
took to that Town, of which he was Master,
even in the Life-time of the Elector his Father;
who when he married his Son to the Emperor
<i>Leopold</i>'s Sister, yielded to him the Duchies of
<i>Juliers</i> and <i>Berg</i>, of which <i>Dusseldorff</i> is the Capital
City, and wou'd have been one of the finest
in <i>Germany</i>, if the Emperor had liv'd long enough
to put the great Projects which he had form'd in
execution. This Prince had already begun to
augment the City with one entire Quarter, the
Streets whereof were as strait as a Line; and I
saw the Plan of a new Palace that he intended
to build, which wou'd certainly have been one
of <i>Europe</i>'s Grand Structures. As to that now
at <i>Dusseldorff</i>, the only beautiful part of it is that
call'd the Gallery; tho' why it has that Name
I can't imagine, since nothing resembles a Gallery
less. It contains five Rooms, three of which
are much bigger than the others. One of these<!--148.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Rooms is quite full of magnificent Paintings by the
famous <i>Rubens</i>. In another there's a great number
of Paintings by <i>Van der Werf</i>, a <i>Dutch</i> Painter who
died lately at the <i>Hague</i>. If a Man has ever so
little Taste or Skill in Painting, 'tis impossible for
him to be indifferent for such Pictures, which
may be said to be all Master-pieces. Such are
those representing the good old Man <i>Simeon</i> holding
the Savior of the World in his Arms; our
Lord teaching in the Temple; and the Pictures
of the Elector and Electoress, in two particular
Rooms of the first Story of this Gallery, are the
Models of the most magnificent Statues of <i>Italy</i>,
sent for by the Elector from all parts of that
Country at a vast Expence. The three others
are full of modern Statues of Marble and Brass,
which are for the most part done by the famous
<i>Gripilli</i> an <i>Italian</i>, and an excellent Artist, especially
for Busts that require a Likeness.</p>

<p>In the Court-yard of the Palace there's an Equestrian
Statue of the Elector arm'd cap-a-pee,
with the Electoral Bonnet on his Head, and
mounted upon a very fine Horse of yellow Copper.
In the same Court there is likewise a very
fine Fountain, the Group of which is of Brass
very curiously wrought, but so incumber'd with
Works of different Kinds, that 'tis difficult to
distinguish them.</p>

<p>Five Leagues from <i>Dusseldorff</i> there's a Hunting-Seat
call'd <i>Bensberg</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, which is built in a
Forest on a Hill, from whence there's a fine
Prospect of the City of <i>Cologne</i>, the <i>Rhine</i>, and
all the flat Country. To this Castle there's a
large Avenue, by a gradual Ascent, till one
comes to the Grate of the first Court, on each<!--149.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
side whereof there's a large Guard-House, the
Front of which forms a Gallery supported by
Pillars of grayish Marble, which is dug in this
Country. The rest of this Seat has very much
the air of the Castle of <i>Versailles</i>, only 'tis not so
large or lofty. In the two Wings of this Building,
there are two Stair-Cases which lead to the Apartments.
'Tis plain that this Structure was
design'd entirely by an <i>Italian</i>; because, according
to the Fashion of that Country, the Apartments
consist of a great number of Rooms all upon
one Floor too, but without any Closets or Conveniencies.
The outside of this Structure is the
oddest thing in the World. It consists of numberless
Ornaments, which 'tis impossible to distinguish:
And I think it no Injustice to the
Castle of <i>Bensberg</i>, to say, 'tis a noble fine House
full of Imperfections.</p>

<p>After having given you an Account of the Elector's
several Buildings, I fancy, <i>Madame</i>,
that some short Memoirs of his Family will not
be disagreeable to you. To be sure you are not
ignorant, that the Succession of the <i>Neubourg</i>
Family to the Dignity of Elector <i>Palatine</i>, is
owing only to the Extinction of the Protestant
<i>Palatine</i> Family, the last of which was the Elector
<i>Charles</i>, who left but one Sister, married
to <span class="smcap">Monsieur</span> <i>Philip</i> of <i>France</i>, Duke of <i>Orleans</i>,
Brother to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. <i>Philip-William</i>
Duke of <i>Neubourg</i>, the Father of him whom I
have had the Honor of mentioning to you, was
the first Elector of this Branch. This Prince,
who had a numerous Family, match'd them to
the chief Crowns of <i>Europe</i>, and he had no less
than four Princes and five Princesses.</p>

<p>The eldest of the Princes was the Elector <i>John-William</i>
of <i>Neubourg</i>, who married to his first<!--150.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Wife an Archduchess of <i>Austria</i>, Sister to the
Emperor <i>Leopold</i>, by whom he had no Issue.
He married to his second Wife <i>Anne-Mary-Louisa</i>
of <i>Medicis</i>, Daughter to <i>Cosmo</i> III. Great
Duke of <i>Tuscany</i>; but having no more Issue by
this Match than by the former, he took the
Hereditary Prince of <i>Sultzbach</i> to his Court,
where he was brought up as the Heir of his Family,
in case that himself and the Princes his
Brothers died without Male Issue. This young
Prince was then look'd upon as the Electoral
Prince, and receiv'd all the Honors as such. The
Person who had the Care of his Education was
the Baron <i>de Seckingen</i>; and it may be said,
that he did his utmost to make a great Prince
of him.</p>

<p>The second was <i>Charles-Lewis</i>, now the Elector.</p>

<p>The third <i>Francis-Lewis de Neubourg</i>, Elector
of <i>Triers</i> and Grand Master of the <i>Teutonic</i> Order.</p>

<p>The fourth <i>Alexander-Sigismond</i>, Bishop of
<i>Augsbourg</i>.</p>

<p>The Princesses were all married. The eldest,
whose Name was <i>Eleonora-Magdalena-Theresa</i>
of <i>Neubourg</i>, married the Emperor <i>Leopold</i>, Father
to the present Emperor, and died <i>Jan. 19,
1719</i>, aged 74.</p>

<p>The second was married to the King of <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<p>The third, nam'd <i>Mary-Anne</i> of <i>Neubourg</i>,
was married to <i>Charles</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth, <i>Dorothy</i> of <i>Neubourg</i> was married
to the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, by whom she had among
other Children Princess <i>Elizabeth Farnese</i>, the
second Wife of <i>Philip</i> V. King of <i>Spain</i>.<!--151.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth and last of these Princesses, <i>Hedwiga-Elizabeth</i>
of <i>Neubourg</i>, was married to <i>James-Lewis
Sobieski</i>, by whom she had <i>Clementina
Sobieski</i>, Wife to the Chevalier <i>de St. George</i>. The
Mother died at <i>Olaw</i> the 10th of <i>August</i> 1722,
aged 50.</p>

<p>After having pass'd some time at the <i>Palatine</i>
Court, I set out about the middle of <i>August</i> for
<i>Francfort</i> on the <i>Main</i>, where I arriv'd a few
days before the opening of the Conferences for
the Election of an Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francfort</span><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> is one of the most considerable
Towns of all <i>Germany</i>, has the Title of an Imperial
City, and is a part of the Diocese of <i>Mentz</i>.
'Tis divided into two parts by the <i>Main</i>, over
which there is a fine Stone Bridge. The frequent
Fires which this City has suffer'd, and especially
that of 1719, have contributed not a little
to its Embellishment, all the Houses being re-built
in a better Taste than before; yet most of the
Buildings are still of Timber and fac'd with
Plaister that is color'd, few private Men having
been at the Expence of building with Stone.
<i>Francfort</i> may thank the <i>Jews</i> for most of those
Fires; for the <i>Jews</i> who are very numerous here,
live in a Quarter by themselves, which is shut
up every Night; and being so narrow, that they
are straiten'd for Room, they are oblig'd to lie
in Heaps as it were upon one another, in very
high Houses, which being moreover of Timber,
easily catch Fire. They have seen their
whole Quarter in Ashes twice successively, because
they refus'd the Assistance they might have
had to extinguish the Flames; for they never
wou'd open their Gates for fear of being robb'd,<!--152.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
unless when they saw that the People were
going to break them open by Force. Notwithstanding
all the Reasons for not suffering them
at <i>Francfort</i>, they have a better Toleration than
the <i>Calvinists</i>, and have fine Synagogues; whereas
the <i>Calvinists</i> do not enjoy the free Exercise
of their Religion, the Magistrates and most of
the Inhabitants being <i>Lutherans</i>.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Francfort</i> is one of the first that
embrac'd the Opinions of <i>Luther</i>, which presently
occasion'd a Revolt: For the Inhabitants
demanding the free Exercise of <i>Lutheranism</i>, and
the Clergy and Senate vigorously opposing it,
there was an Insurrection, in which the Inhabitants
having the Advantage, they depos'd the
Senate, and establish'd a sort of Magistracy compos'd
of twenty-four, taken from the Body of
the Populace. These Acts of Violence had such
fatal Consequences, that at last in 1530 the City
embrac'd the Confession of <i>Augsbourg</i>, enter'd
into the League of <i>Smalcald</i>, and had a share in
the other Calamities which afflicted the Empire.
'Twas besieg'd twice in 1552, by <i>Maurice</i> Elector
of <i>Saxony</i>, and by <i>Albert</i> Margrave of
<i>Brandenburg</i>, surnam'd the <i>Alcibiades</i> of <i>Germany</i>,
who made himself Master of it; but it
soon after recover'd its Liberty, and since that
time has increas'd very much. The Elections
and Coronations of the Emperors render it a very
considerable Place. These two Grand Ceremonies
are perform'd in the Church of St. <i>Bartholomew</i>,
which is a vile, little, dark Building, very improper,
in short, for Solemnities of that sort.
The Imperial Feast is kept on the very Day of
the Coronation, in the Great Hall of the Town-house,
which is indeed a very wide but irregular
Room. The Town-house is called <i>Romer</i>:<!--153.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
They say 'twas anciently the House of a private
Gentleman, who made a Present of it to the
City. If that be true, it may be said the Gentleman
liv'd at large.</p>

<p>This City has considerable Fairs, which draw
a great Number of Merchants to it and People
of Quality. The River <i>Main</i> which falls into
the <i>Rhine</i> near <i>Mentz</i>, is a great Advantage to
its Commerce. This, <i>Madame</i>, is within a
Trifle all that can be said of <i>Francfort</i>. I am
now to have the Honor of giving you a particular
Account of the chief Circumstances that attended
the Election and Coronation of the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Conferences for the Election were open'd
on the 25th of <i>August</i>, and held from nine
o'clock in the Morning till Noon. The Plenipotentiaries
of the absent Electors therein communicated
their full Powers, and referr'd them
to the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>, who afterwards made
a Speech upon what had given occasion to that
August Assembly. In this first Session it was resolv'd,
that every thing there treated of shou'd
be kept secret; and then they adjourn'd.</p>

<p>The March of the Electors of <i>Mentz</i> and
<i>Triers</i> to and from the Town-house was very
grand. The first was <i>Lotharius-Francis de Schonborn</i>,
of the Family of the Counts of <i>Schonborn</i>;
and the second was <i>Charles-Joseph de Lorrain</i>,
who was of the <i>Lorrain</i> Family, and died
in 1715, on the 4th of <i>December</i>. These two
Princes rode each in a great Coach, cover'd with
black Cloth, attended by all their Houshold and
Guards in close Mourning.</p>

<p>The Equipages of the Ambassadors of the absent
Electors were very spruce, especially the Equipages
of the Ambassadors of <i>Saxony</i>, who had
also the Honor to have with them their Master's<!--154.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Son, who went by the Name of the Count of
<i>Lusatia</i>. Besides, the King of <i>Poland</i> had given
them his own Equipage, and permitted
them to cloath their Domestics in his Livery.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors whom the King (of <i>Prussia</i>)
sent in quality of Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i>, appear'd
likewise with a Splendor worthy of the
Prince whom they represented. They were the
Count <i>de Dlona</i> and M. <i>Henning</i>; but the former
had the Honors of the Embassy. This Minister
appear'd with a Train of 40 Gentlemen of the
King's Bed-chamber; he had 5 Coaches drawn
by 6 Horses each, 8 Pages, 36 Footmen and 2
<i>Swiss</i>. M. <i>Henning</i>, who was appointed to attend
to the Business, had not the Satisfaction to
see the Success of these Assemblies; for having
in the very first Session spoke with great Zeal
for the Interests of his Country, he heated himself
to such a degree, that he found himself out
of Order when he came home; and that very
Night he had a Fit of an Apoplexy of which
he died next day. The Count <i>de Metternich</i>
was appointed to supply his Place. No body
was fitter to serve the King in the Assembly at
<i>Francfort</i> than this Nobleman, who had in several
Embassies acquir'd a great Knowledge of
the Affairs of the Empire; and particularly in
the Embassy at <i>Ratisbon</i>, in which he was employ'd
a long time.</p>

<p>As soon as the Conferences were open'd, the
Foreign Ministers, <i>viz.</i> the Pope's Nuncio, the
Envoys of <i>Savoy</i> and of the other Princes of <i>Italy</i>,
the Envoy Extraordinary of the States-General,
and those of the Princes of the Empire, notify'd
their Arrival to the Electoral College, and sent
their Credentials to the Chancery, which was<!--155.png--><span class="pagenum">149</span>
kept at the Palace of the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>, that
Prince being by Birth Chancellor of the Empire.</p>

<p>At the beginning of these Conferences there
were some Difficulties started, relating to the Pretensions
of the Nuncio and Nephew of the then
Pope <i>Clement</i> XI. who pretended that the Electors
should pay him the first Visit; and that
when he return'd it to them, they were bound
to give him the Right Hand. The Electors
were very much startled at the Nuncio's Demand,
and publickly refus'd to subscribe to such Claims;
so that no Visit was made on either side, and
the Nuncio only saw the Electors in a Garden
where they happen'd to meet by Chance. The
Nuncio threaten'd he would protest against
the Ninth Electorate establish'd in favor of
the Family of <i>Brunswic-Hanover</i>, and against
the Royal Dignity of <i>Prussia</i>; but he was given
to understand, that neither of his Protestations
would avail any thing. And the Ambassadors
of <i>Prussia</i> sent him word in plain Terms, that
if he offered to protest against the Regal Dignity
of their Master, the King would not fail
to give Order to his Troops that were in <i>Italy</i>,
to enter into the Ecclesiastic State, and to live at
Discretion therein, as if it were an Enemy's
Country. The Nuncio frighted by those Menaces,
and thinking he already saw the <i>Prussian</i>
Troops in his Holiness's Territories, sent
his Secretary forthwith to the Ambassadors to
assure them that he wou'd not protest; that he
never had a Thought nor Order for it; that his
Holiness had all the Respect and Esteem for
the King their Master which so great a Prince
deserv'd; and that he would be glad to give
Proofs of it upon every Occasion.<!--156.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>The Electors of <i>Cologn</i> and <i>Bavaria</i> protested
likewise against the Assembly, in case they
were refused Admission to the Conferences for
the Election; but they were of no more avail
than those of the Nuncio. Those Princes sent
their Protests by the Post, in form of Letters,
directed to the Count <i>de Papenheim</i> Marshal of
the Empire, and seal'd with an unknown Seal.
The Situation those Electors stood in at that time,
did not permit them to cause their Protests to be
publish'd with the due Formalities, nevertheless
they were soon made public. The Respect
and Friendship People had for the illustrious
Family of <i>Bavaria</i>, made every body eager to
have Copies of 'em, but they signify'd nothing,
and the Conferences continu'd.</p>

<p>On the 2d of <i>October</i> the Conferences being
ended for that Day, the Magistrates and Heads
of the Militia, went in a Body to the Town-house,
to take the Oath prescrib'd by the Golden Bull.
They there found the Electors, who were at that
time in <i>Francfort</i>, and the Ambassadors of the
absent Electors, all sitting in Chairs of State,
under a great Canopy of black Velvet. After the
Oath was read, the Magistrates and the Officers
of the Militia took it in presence of the Elector
of <i>Mentz</i>, as did also the Citizens and the Garison,
but the Ceremony was different; for it was
not taken in the Town-house, but without it,
in an open Gallery, rais'd in a great Square, and
hung with Cloth. There the Chancellors of the
two Spiritual Electors and the Magistrates receiv'd
the Oath of the Citizens, in presence of
the Electors and Ambassadors, who were plac'd
at the Windows of the Town-house. The
Burghers, who were to the Number of 14 Companies,<!--157.png--><span class="pagenum">151</span>
took the Oath first, and then the Soldiers
of the Garrison.</p>

<p>On the 10th of <i>October</i> Proclamation was made
by Sound of Trumpet for all Foreigners, who
were not in the Retinue of the Electors, or the
Electoral Ambassadors, to retire out of the City
before the Sun was set, till the Electors had chose
an Emperor. The Nuncio thought at first,
that his Character and the Respect due to the
Holy Father would exempt him from the general
Rule; but being inform'd of the contrary,
he retir'd to <i>Aschaffenbourg</i>.</p>

<p>On the 12th, about seven in the Morning all
the Bells were rung, upon which the Burghers
and the Soldiers of the Garrison assembled at the
Houses of their respective commanding Officers;
and then went and posted themselves in the
Streets leading from the Town-house to the
Church of St. <i>Bartholomew</i>. The Burghers had
the Post of Honor from the Soldiers. At nine
o'clock the Electors and Ambassadors went to
the Town-house, the Courts and Equipages of
all but the Ambassadors of <i>Bohemia</i> having laid
aside their Mourning.</p>

<p>The Moment after the Electors arriv'd in the
usual Chamber of the Assembly they went into
other Rooms, where they caus'd themselves to
be dress'd in their Electoral Habits, which are
very majestic, being wide Gowns very much
plaited with very long Sleeves, the Linings and
Facings being of Ermin; and over all the Electors
wear a sort of Mantle of Ermin. The
Habits for the Spiritual and Temporal Electors
are much the same, only those of the former
are of Scarlet, and those of the latter of Crimson-Velvet.
Their Caps are of the Color of their
Habits, and like them turn'd up with Ermin.<!--158.png--><span class="pagenum">152</span></p>

<p>As soon as the Electors were dress'd they return'd
to the Assembly-Room, and then went
with the Ambassadors of the other Electors from
the Town-House to the Square, where they found
Horses sumptuously caparison'd, which they
mounted, and thus rode in Cavalcade to St. <i>Bartholomew</i>'s
Church. The three Electors rode
first in one Row bare-headed. The four Ambassadors
of the absent Electors rode next, according
to the Rank of their Masters. Their
Electoral Highnesses and the Ambassadors were
receiv'd at the Door of the Church by the Bishop
of <i>Neustadt</i> at the Head of the Chapter,
who conducted them into the Choir, where they
plac'd themselves, according to their Rank, in the
Stalls of the Canons, which were lin'd with Velvet
and Gold-Lace. The Elector of <i>Triers</i> sate
by himself opposite to the Altar, where a Praying-Desk
and an Arm-Chair were set up for him,
which were lin'd also with Crimson-Velvet.</p>

<p>When all the Company were seated, the Bishop
of <i>Neustadt</i> began the Mass. At the first Consecration,
the Ambassadors of the Protestant Electors
went into the Chappel of the Conclave
which joins to the Choir: After the Elevation
of the Host they return'd to their Places, where
they remain'd during the rest of the Office, and
then the Electors and Ambassadors all went up
to the Altar. The Elector of <i>Mentz</i> was in the
middle between the Elector of <i>Triers</i> on his
Right and the Elector-Palatine on his Left. The
Ambassadors were in the same Row, according
to their Rank, on the Right and Left of the Electors.
The Elector of <i>Mentz</i> took the Book
of the Gospels and laid his Right Hand upon it,
as did also the Electors that were present, and the
Ambassadors of those who were absent, and then<!--159.png--><span class="pagenum">153</span>
took the customary Oath to elect no Person for
Emperor but one that they should think in Conscience
to be most qualify'd. After having taken
the Oath they went into the Chapel of the Conclave,
where they were shut up near three Hours.
Then they return'd into the Church and plac'd
themselves in a Gallery erected over the Grate
that separates the Choir from the Nave, which
was lin'd with Scarlet Cloth and hung with
Tapestry, and had seven Arm-Chairs plac'd in it
of red Velvet, adorn'd with Lace and Fringe of
Gold. The Electors and Ambassadors being
seated, the Chancellor of <i>Mentz</i> read aloud the
Act which had been just drawn up in the Conclave,
whereby <span class="smcap">Charles</span> King of the <i>Romans</i>,
and of <i>Spain</i>, was proclaim'd Emperor. Then
the whole Church resounded with great Shouts
of <i>Long live the Emperor</i>! And at the same instant
the Cannon was fir'd from the Ramparts,
and the Burghers and the Garison made three
Discharges of their small Arms.</p>

<p>After the Proclamation the Electors and the
Ambassadors descended from the Gallery to their
Places in the Choir, and after the singing of <i>Te
Deum</i> which was tun'd by the Bishop of <i>Neustadt</i>,
they return'd to the Town-House in the
same Order that they came. There the Electors
quitted their Robes of Ceremony, and each return'd
to their Palaces, where they stay'd till the
Evening; and the Ambassadors did the same.
At Night they all supp'd at the House of the
Count <i>de Windisgratcht</i>, the first Ambassador of
<i>Bohemia</i>, and by consequence the Ambassador of
the new Emperor, who gave a magnificent Feast,
which was accompany'd with a very fine Concert
of Music. This great Day's Work was concluded
by the Choice which the Electoral College made<!--160.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of Prince <i>Charles</i> of <i>Neubourg</i>, to carry to the
new Emperor the Act of his Proclamation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the surprizing Concourse of
People from all Quarters to see this august Ceremony,
there was not the least Disorder in the
whole Solemnity, excepting a little Dispute that
happen'd between the Prince <i>de la Tour Taxis</i>
and the Count of <i>Nassau-Weilbourg</i>. The former,
tho' of a modern Family in comparison to the
Count, yet presuming upon his Title of Prince,
claim'd Precedency of the Count, but the latter
decided the Difference in an instant; for he took
the Prince by the Arm, and pushing him
behind him, said to him, <i>You are to know, Sir,
that such Princes as you are, walk behind such
Counts as I am</i>. The Prince very much stunn'd
at the Compliment, did not think proper to
push his Pretensions farther.</p>

<p>Immediately after the Ceremony of the Election
was over, I set out for <i>Zell</i>, where I had the
Misfortune to find my self Motherless as well as
Fatherless. My Mother having died there during
my stay at <i>Francfort</i>, whose Death grieved
me very much, and the more because 'twas the
first Incident I had met with in all my Life to
give me a serious Concern: But now perhaps,
that I am more us'd to Disappointments, such
News would not make so much Impression upon
me as it did then.</p>

<p>I stay'd some time at <i>Zell</i> to settle several Affairs
with my Brother relating to my Mother's
Succession, till I had a Letter acquainting me
that the Ceremony of the Emperor's Coronation
was fix'd for the 22d of <i>December</i>, and thereupon
I set out immediately again for <i>Francfort</i>.<!--161.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>I travell'd thro' <i>Hanover</i>, which I have already
had the Honor to mention to you, and
from <i>Hanover</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Cassel</span>, which Town
is the common Residence of the Landgrave of
<i>Hesse</i>, and divided into two Parts by the River
<i>Fulde</i>. The New Town is very well built with
pretty Houses, and the Streets are very even
and spacious. The Landgrave's Palace which is
old is encompass'd with Ramparts, part of which
on that side next to the Country forms a Terras
planted with Orange-Trees, which in Winter
are cover'd by a boarded House. The Name
of the present Landgrave is <i>Charles</i>, who was
born the 3d of <i>August</i> 1654, and has had seven
Children by <i>Mary-Amelia</i> of <i>Courland</i>.</p>

<p>1. Prince <i>Frederic</i>, born the 28th of <i>August</i>
1676, who became King of <i>Sweden</i> by his Marriage
with <i>Eleonora</i> Princess of <i>Sweden</i>, who succeeded
<i>Charles</i> XII. He had to his first Wife
<i>Louisa-Dorothea-Sophia</i> only Daughter of the
King of <i>Prussia</i>, at which time he was Stadtholder
of <i>Cleves</i>, and had a Regiment of Foot
in his Majesty's Service.</p>

<p>2. The Princess <i>Sophia-Charlotta</i> Duchess-Dowager
of <i>Mecklemburg-Swerin</i>, who lives still
in <i>Mecklemburg</i>, from whence she often goes to
the Court of her Father.</p>

<p>3. Prince <i>William</i>, who is a Lieutenant-General
of the <i>Dutch</i> Forces, and Governor of <i>Maestricht</i>.
He marry'd <i>Wilhelmina</i> of <i>Saxe-Zeits</i>.</p>

<p>4. The Princess <i>Mary-Louisa</i>, Dowager of
the Prince of <i>Nassau-Friesland</i> drown'd in his
Passage at the <i>Moerdyke</i>.</p>

<p>5. The Prince <i>Maximilian</i>, marry'd to a Princess
of <i>Hesse-Darmstad</i>.</p>

<p>6. The Prince <i>George</i>, a General Officer in the
Service of <i>Prussia</i>, Colonel of a Regiment of<!--162.png--><span class="pagenum">156</span>
Foot, and Knight of the Order of the Black
Eagle.</p>

<p>7. <i>Wilhelmina-Charlotte</i>, who was a most accomplish'd
Princess, but died some time ago.</p>

<p>These Princes and Princesses met very often
at the Court of the Landgrave their Father, and
then render'd it one of the most splendid in <i>Germany</i>,
not only by reason of their Magnificence,
but for their affable Deportment to all Mankind,
but especially to Foreigners. I was loth to go
from <i>Cassel</i>, but as the Term fix'd for the Emperor's
Coronation drew near, I could not stay
there any longer.</p>

<p>And indeed, I arrived at <span class="smcap">Francfort</span> but a
few Hours before the Emperor. The Electors
and Ambassadors went out of Town and met
his Imperial Majesty, as did also the Magistrates
with the Burgo-Master, and complimented him
under a Tent erected there for that purpose.
When the Compliments were ended his Majesty
went again into his Coach, as did the Electors
and Ambassadors into theirs, and they enter'd the
City while the Cannon fir'd and the People
shouted, <i>Long live the Emperor Charles</i> VI.
His Imperial Majesty alighted at the Church of
St. <i>Bartholomew</i>. The Elector-Palatine who was
so indispos'd that he could not go out to meet
his Majesty, receiv'd him at the Door of the
Church, as did also the Bishop of <i>Neustadt</i> at
the Head of the Chapter; and his Majesty was
conducted to a Throne set up for him on the
Right-side of the Altar, by the Electors. The
Elector-Palatine walk'd before, and the two other
Electors supported the Emperor. When
he was seated on his Throne, the Bishop tun'd
the <i>Te Deum</i>, and gave the Benediction. The
Emperor was afterwards conducted with the<!--163.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
same Ceremonies to his Palace, which was hung
with Mourning. The Electors and Ambassadors
having accompany'd his Imperial Majesty to his
Closet, retir'd to their respective Habitations.
The next and following Days the Emperor receiv'd
the Visits of the Electors, the Ambassadors,
and the Electoress Palatine, which he
return'd.</p>

<p>When the 22d of <i>December</i>, the Day fix'd for
the Coronation, was arriv'd, all the Burghers and
the Garison were drawn up under Arms all the
way from the Imperial Palace to the Church.
The Procession was begun by the Footmen and
Pages belonging to the Ambassadors, to the Elector-Palatine
and to the Emperor, and they were
follow'd by the Courtiers of the Elector and of
the Emperor, and by Persons of Quality that
were in the Ambassadors Retinue. After them
there appear'd six Heralds at Arms, the first of
which carry'd a single Eagle, the second a double
Cross, the third a Lion, and the three others
Spread-Eagles, the whole after the manner of the
<i>Roman</i> Ensigns. After the Heralds, came the
Ambassadors, the Vicars of the Electors, and the
Elector-Palatine, bearing the <i>Imperialia</i> or Ornaments
of the Empire; and immediately after
them the Emperor appear'd, under a stately Canopy.
His Habit was like that of the Secular
Electors, that is to say, a Robe of Crimson-Velvet
turn'd up with Ermin: He had on his Head
a Crown enrich'd with Diamonds, which was
the Crown of his Family, and he rode a very
fine <i>Spanish</i> Horse, the Equipage of which was
truly magnificent. Behind the Emperor came
the principal Officers of his Houshold, and the
Captain of the Guards at the Head of his Company;<!--164.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
and the Elector-Palatine's Life-Guards
closed the March.</p>

<p>When the Emperor arrived at the Church,
the Electors of <i>Mentz</i> and <i>Triers</i> in their Pontificalibus
went and receiv'd him at the Door,
from whence they conducted him to his Seat in
the Choir over-against the High Altar. There
his Imperial Majesty heard the Mass, after which
he was conducted to the Town-House almost in
the same Order as was observ'd at his coming to
Church, with this Difference, that the Emperor
was deck'd with the Ornaments of the Empire,
which consist of the Crown, the Mantle, and
<i>Charlemain</i>'s Sword. His Majesty was now on
foot between the two Ecclesiastical Electors,
who accompany'd him, as did the Elector-Palatine,
and the Vicars and Ambassadors of the absent
Electors to the Great Hall of the Town-House,
where the Imperial Feast was prepar'd.
The Emperor plac'd himself at one of the Windows
looking into the great Square, on purpose
to be seen by the People; of whom there was
such a Multitude, that not only the Square but
the Windows and Roofs of the Houses were
cover'd with them.</p>

<p>From this Window his Majesty saw the Officers
of the Empire perform their Functions.
The Count <i>de Papenheim</i> the Elector of <i>Saxony</i>'s
Vicar, as Grand Marshal of the Empire, was the
first that began the Ceremony. He was mounted
on a very fine Horse, which he rode full gallop
to a Heap of Oats in one Corner of the
Square, wherewith he fill'd a Measure of Silver,
after which he return'd to the Middle of the
Square, where he threw both the Oats and the
Measure among the Populace, and then he went
to the Banquetting-Room.<!--165.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>The Elector-Palatine appear'd next, encompass'd
with his Guards, and preceded by his
Courtiers. He went on horseback to a Kitchen
built for the purpose in the great Square, where
he found a whole Ox roasting on a Spit, of which
he cut off a Slice, and putting it into a Gold
Dish he carry'd it to the Emperor's Table.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Zinzendorf</i>, Vicar to the Elector
of <i>Hanover</i> as Treasurer of the Empire, came
next. He was on horseback attended by the
Emperor's Guards, and taking a compass round
the Square he scatter'd Medals of Gold and Silver
among the Populace, which he took out of
a couple of Bags of Cloth that were ty'd to his
Saddle-Bow. These Medals represented on one
side the Globe of the Earth encompass'd with
Clouds, and this <i>Latin</i> Inscription, <i>Constantiâ &amp;
Fortitudine</i>. On the other side was this Legend,
<i>Carolus, Hispaniarum, Hung. &amp; Bohem. Rex.
A. A. Electus in Regem Roman. coronat. Francof.
22 Decemb. 1711</i>. Over which there was
an Imperial Crown like to that of <i>Charlemain</i>.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Dhona</i> Ambassador from the
King as Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i>, perform'd the
Function of Great Chamberlain of the Empire
in the absence of the Prince of <i>Hohenzollern</i> the
Elector's Vicar, who was at that time indispos'd.
The Count preceded by all his Livery, and accompany'd
by some of the Emperor's Guards,
rode on horseback towards the middle of the
Square, where a Table was erected on which
there was a Basin and Ewer of Silver gilt full
of Water, with a Napkin that had been dipp'd
in it, all which he took and carry'd into the
Banquetting-Room, and gave to the Emperor
to wash.<!--166.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards the Count <i>de Kinski</i>, Ambassador
of his Imperial Majesty as King of <i>Bohemia</i>, officiated
for the Person whom he represented, as
Great Cup-Bearer of the Empire: For this purpose
he took a Goblet of Gold and fetch'd Wine
at a Fountain erected in the middle of the Square
representing the Imperial Eagle; which done,
the Count went into the Banquetting-Room, and
gave it to the Emperor to drink.</p>

<p>Thus did the Officers of the Empire acquit
themselves of their several Functions: After
this the Emperor plac'd himself alone at a Table
upon a rais'd Floor, cover'd with red Cloth; and
over it there was a Canopy of Gold Brocade.
When the Emperor was seated the Electors
plac'd themselves at Tables that were prepar'd
for them on both sides of the Hall, on Floors
that were a Step lower than the Emperor's. Over
each Table there was a Canopy of Crimson-Velvet
inrich'd with Gold, and they had each
an Arm-Chair of the same. On the Right-side
of each Table there was a magnificent Beaufet.
The three Electors sate alone at their several
Tables, and the Ambassadors of the absent Electors,
after having stood a little while behind the Chairs
plac'd for their respective Masters, went into another
Room. On the following Days the Electors
din'd with the Emperor, and his Majesty
went also and din'd with the Electors. At length,
after the Emperor had perform'd all the Ceremonies
that are observ'd at Coronations, he set
out from <i>Francfort</i> for his Hereditary Dominions,
where he was impatiently expected by
his Subjects.</p>

<p>Just as I was ready to depart from <i>Francfort</i>
I receiv'd the melancholy News of the Death
of the King's Brother the Margrave <i>Philip</i>, to<!--167.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
whom I was very much attached, and was therefore
mightily afflicted for the Loss of him.
The King's Ambassadors, to avoid the Expence
of putting their Equipage in Mourning,
kept his Death secret, so that they did not notify
it to his Imperial Majesty till the Day before
he went.</p>

<p>I set out from <i>Francfort</i> much about the same
time as the Emperor did, and pass'd through
<i>Cassel</i>, <i>Hanover</i>, and <i>Dusseldorff</i>. I lik'd <i>Francfort</i>
so well before, that it tempted me to return
to it; and besides, that was the Place to which
a Passport was to be directed that I had sent for
from <i>France</i>, in order to carry me to <i>Paris</i>. As
soon as I receiv'd it I traveled thro' <i>Minden</i>,
which I have already had the Honor to mention
to you; and from thence, after having pass'd
through <i>Bilefeld</i> a little Town in the County of
<i>Ravensberg</i>, I arriv'd at <span class="smcap">Munster</span>.</p>

<p>This, which was formerly an Imperial City, is
now the See of a Bishop, Prince of the Empire,
and Lord of the Town and its Jurisdiction. It
stands in <i>Westphalia</i> in a large Plain, and on a
little River which renders it very strong. It was
the Birth-place of the famous <i>Muntzer</i>, the
Head of the Anabaptists, a Sect of Heretics,
who grew so powerful that they undertook to
make themselves Masters of the City, and to
chuse themselves a King; and about the End
of the sixteenth Century, they accordingly chose
for their Sovereign one <i>John of Leyden</i>, a Taylor,
infamous for the Cruelties and Outrages which
he committed. But Heaven deliver'd the City
from such a Scourge; for at length after some
Resistance it was reduc'd, and <i>John of Leyden</i>
was put to death by the Hangman. The City
revolted again afterwards; but at last the Bishop<!--168.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
humbled it in 1661, and since that time it has
always been subject to the Bishops its Sovereigns.
'Twas at <i>Munster</i> that was held the famous Assembly
of <i>Westphalia</i>, which establish'd the Fortune
of many Sovereigns, and the Religion of
their Subjects. The Peace which was there
sign'd serves also as a Basis for all the Treaties
that are made at this time. The Treaty of
<i>Munster</i> imported in substance, "That <i>Maximilian</i>
Duke of <i>Bavaria</i> should remain in
Possession of the Electorate of the Counts Palatine,
which had been given him by the
Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i> II: That <i>Charles Lewis</i>
Count Palatine should be restor'd to his Principality,
and be created an eighth Elector for
himself and his Descendants. That the Protestants
should have their Churches and the
free Exercise of their Religion, on the Footing
as it was in 1624; and that they should
retain the Church-Revenues, of which they
had been possess'd ever since the first of <i>January</i>,
that Year: That <i>Sweden</i> should have
Hither-<i>Pomerania</i>, a Part of the other <i>Pomerania</i>,
the Island and Principality of <i>Rugen</i>,
the Town and Port of <i>Wismar</i>, Archbishopric
of <i>Bremen</i>, and the Bishopric of <i>Verden</i>, with
the Title of a Duchy: That the Elector of
<i>Brandenburg</i> should have the Bishoprics of
<i>Halberstadt</i>, <i>Minden</i> and <i>Camin</i>, with the
Farther-<i>Pomerania</i>: That <i>France</i> should have
the intire Sovereignty of <i>Metz</i>, <i>Toul</i>, and
<i>Verdun</i>, and the Dependencies thereof, that
of <i>Pignerol</i> and <i>Brisac</i>, the Landgraviate of
Upper and Lower <i>Alsace</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> That the
Confederates should restore the Towns they
had taken, and disband their Troops; and
that the seven Circles of the Empire should<!--169.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
furnish five Millions of Rixdollars for the
Pay of the <i>Swedish</i> Soldiers." Such were the
Conditions of this Peace, which was not very advantageous
to the Catholic Religion.</p>

<p>The Bishop who had the See of <i>Munster</i> while
I was there, was of the Family of <i>Metternich</i>,
and at the same time Bishop of <i>Paderborn</i>. I
did not stay long in that City, but proceeded
thro' <i>Dusseldorff</i>, where I found the whole Court
return'd from <i>Francfort</i>.</p>

<p>From thence I set out for <span class="smcap">Cologne</span><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, where
M. <i>Happe</i> who was appointed by the King to
levy the Contributions which <i>Luxembourg</i> and
other neighbouring Countries were oblig'd to
pay, entertain'd me very civilly, gave me an Apartment
at his House, and made me exceeding
welcome.</p>

<p>I stay'd some time in this City, which is a
very flourishing Town by reason of its convenient
Situation for the Trade of their Merchants,
who have great Vessels constantly going up and
down the <i>Rhine</i>, to <i>Francfort</i> and <i>Holland</i>. 'Tis
a pretty large City, but always very dirty and ill
pav'd, and the Houses are for most part very
old, and consequently dark and incommodious.
The City is governed by a Senate, which does
not depend on the Elector, whose Power is very
much limited, he having no Authority but in
Criminal Affairs; yet he is allow'd Sovereign
Command for three Days, after which if he stays
at <i>Cologne</i> he is no more regarded than a private
Gentleman. This is the reason that the Prince
commonly resides at <i>Bonn</i>, and that he only goes
to <i>Cologne</i> on the Eves of the Grand Festivals,
to officiate there. Nevertheless the City is oblig'd<!--170.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
to pay Homage to the Elector, and to swear Fidelity
to him, on Condition that he preserve
them in the Enjoyment of their Privileges;
which is a Condition that the Elector can scarce
violate were he ever so much inclin'd to it, because
'tis the City that maintains the Garison,
and is Mistress of the Arsenal.</p>

<p>The Catholic is the only Religion that is allow'd
to be exercised at <i>Cologne</i>. Nor are Protestants
admitted into the Senate, or any Employment
in the City, but go to preach at <i>Mulheim</i>,
a little Town in the Country of <i>Berg</i>,
which belongs to the Elector-Palatine.</p>

<p>I had not the Honor of seeing the Elector, who
by reason of the Misfortunes he had suffer'd in
the late Wars, was oblig'd at that time to live in
<i>France</i>. His Name was <i>Joseph-Clement</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>.
He possess'd the Bishoprics of <i>Hildesheim</i>
and <i>Liege</i>, together with the Archbishopric
of <i>Cologne</i>. He died the 12th of <i>November</i>
1723, after having caus'd his Nephew the Duke
<i>Clement</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>, Bishop of <i>Munster</i> and <i>Paderborn</i>
to be chose Co-adjutor of <i>Cologne</i>.</p>

<p>The Archbishops of <i>Cologne</i> are Great Chancellors
of the Empire in <i>Italy</i>, but don't officiate
as such; for most of the Princes of <i>Italy</i> pretend
to be independent of the Empire, or call
themselves perpetual Vicars thereof; and in this
Quality they perform what the Emperor might
do within the Extent of their Jurisdictions.
This however extends only to common Cases,
for in extraordinary ones they are oblig'd to have
recourse to the Imperial Court. Then 'tis the Elector
of <i>Mentz</i> alone who officiates in quality
of Chancellor of <i>Germany</i>; and 'tis he that has
the Custody of the Archives and Titles which
relate to <i>Italy</i>.<!--171.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>The Electors of <i>Cologne</i> for a long time contested
with those of <i>Mentz</i> the Right of consecrating
the Emperors, tho' the latter pretend
this Honor belongs to them, as Primates of <i>Germany</i>.
But the Differences between those Princes
have been regulated; and they have agreed
that either of them, in whose Diocese the Emperor
happens to be crown'd, should consecrate
him; and that if the Coronation should be perform'd
in neither of their Dioceses, then they
should take it by turns. Nevertheless after this
Accommodation the Elector of <i>Cologne</i> consecrated
the Emperor <i>Leopold</i> in 1658, at <i>Francfort</i>
a City in the Diocese of <i>Mentz</i>; but it was
done with the Consent of the Elector of <i>Mentz</i>,
and without making it a Precedent for the
future.</p>

<p>I have observ'd, that at <i>Cologne</i> most of the
public Buildings are either Churches or Convents.
The Metropolitan Church would be one of the
most magnificent in all <i>Germany</i>, were it finish'd.
Among other stately Tombs here is that of the
<i>Three Kings</i> who came to worship the Savior of
the World, whose Bodies they say were remov'd
from <i>Constantinople</i> to <i>Milan</i>, and from thence
brought hither. All the People have a very
great Veneration for these Reliques.</p>

<p>Except the Churches and the Monasteries one
sees no public Structures, nor any House fine
enough to raise a Stranger's Admiration; here
is still to be seen the House where Death put an
end to the Misfortunes of <i>Mary de Medicis</i>,
Queen of <i>France</i>, who came to <i>Cologne</i> for Refuge
from the Persecution of Cardinal <i>Richelieu</i>.
This Cardinal, tho' he was oblig'd to that Princess
for his prodigious Wealth, was not content
with having forc'd her to quit the Kingdom of<!--172.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
<i>France</i>, but abridg'd her even of the Necessaries
of Life; insomuch that 'twas a hard matter for
her to find a Butcher that would undertake to
serve the Table of that unfortunate Princess with
Meat. She died the 3d of <i>July</i>, 1643.</p>

<p>After I had amused my self with seeing what
was to be seen in the City of <i>Cologne</i>, I long'd so
much to see that famous City <i>Paris</i>, that I set
out thither very soon. I forgot to tell you that
the Out-works of <i>Cologne</i>, especially the Ramparts
are very agreeable. There are noble Rows
of Elms which serve for Walks, and terminate
in a Kay that runs along the <i>Rhine</i>, and would
be a very fine one, if it was not disfigur'd by a
Half-moon, which has been cut out to cover the
Gate of the <i>Rhine</i>, and to secure the Passage of
the Flying-Bridge.</p>

<p>When I set out from <i>Cologne</i> I went down the
<i>Rhine</i> and the <i>Vahal</i>, as far as <i>Dort</i>, and from
thence (without once going ashore) to <span class="smcap">Antwerp</span>,
which City I take to be the most beautiful of all
the <i>Netherlands</i>. It makes a part of <i>Austrian
Brabant</i>, and is the Capital of the Marquisate of
the Holy Empire. 'Tis situate in a great Plain
on the Right-side of the <i>Schelde</i>, at a Place where
that River separates the Duchy of <i>Brabant</i> from
the County of <i>Flanders</i>. It contains a number
of Churches built in a very good Taste, and a
great many very noble public Edifices. The
Church of our Lady, which is the Cathedral, is a
Work that has nothing like it except it be in <i>Italy</i>.
'Tis above 500 Feet in length, 240 in
breadth, and 340 in height. It contains Sixty-six
Chapels, adorn'd with Marble Columns, all
different, and with fine Paintings. The Tower
which serves for the Steeple is very lofty and
perfectly beautiful.<!--173.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>The most magnificent of the Churches, next
to the Cathedral, was that of the <i>Jesuits</i>, which
was consum'd by Lightning the 18th of <i>July</i>,
1718. The Pavement was of Marble, in Compartiments.
There were two low Isles, one above
the other, which were supported by fifty-six
Marble Pillars. The four Arches were clos'd
with thirty-eight great Pictures in gilt Frames,
and the Walls in which there were forty Windows
were lin'd with Marble. The great Roof
was of very fine carv'd Work, charg'd with a
small Dome, very lightsome and very well made.
As to the High Altar it would require an able
Connoisseur to give such a Description of it as
the Beauty of the Workmanship requires: For
my own part all I can say of it is, that 'twas all
over Marble, Jasper, Porphyry, and Gold. The
Picture represented the Assumption of the Virgin
<i>Mary</i>, and was a complete Piece. Our Lady's
Chapel, which was a part of the same Church,
was as rich as the rest of the Building, the Sides
and the Roof of it being fac'd with Marble, and
adorn'd with six Statues of Alabaster. Besides
this Chapel there were fifty others, all of the utmost
Magnificence. The Great Gate of the
Church, and the <i>Jesuits</i> College adjoining to it,
were answerable to the Beauty of the Structure.
All this stately Building was entirely destroy'd;
and what is most to be pitied, the Pictures of
the famous <i>Rubens</i>, of which this Church was
full, were destroy'd with it; a Loss the more
considerable, because 'tis not to be repair'd; for
as to the rest, they are preparing to build a
Church as magnificent as the former.</p>

<p>There are several other fine Edifices at <i>Antwerp</i>,
of which I don't undertake the Description.
I shall only mention a Word or two of<!--174.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the Town-House and the Exchange. The former
stands in a great Square, encompass'd with
fine Houses. Tho' the Building is quite in the
<i>Gothic</i> Taste, yet 'tis a noble Monument of the
Wealth of those who founded it. The Exchange
is worth seeing, on account of the Galleries round
the Square, in which the Merchants assemble as
they do at <i>Amsterdam</i>, from 12 o'clock till half
an hour past 1.</p>

<p>The Citadel or Castle of <i>Antwerp</i> was formerly
reckon'd one of the strongest and most regular
Citadels in <i>Europe</i>; but the Works which <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. caus'd to be made in the <i>Netherlands</i>,
and upon all the Frontiers of the Kingdom, have
very much sunk the Reputation of the ancient
Fortifications. 'Twas in the Square of this
Castle, which was built by Order of the Duke
of <i>Alva</i>, that he caus'd that famous Statue of
Brass to be erected, which would have been an
eternal Monument of his Pride and Cruelty, if
it had not been pull'd down and broke to pieces
by the Populace, as soon as the Duke quitted
the <i>Netherlands</i> by Order of his Master K. <i>Philip</i>
II. 'Tis said that while he commanded in this
Country, he caus'd above 18000 Persons to be
executed by the common Hangman.</p>

<p>Next to the Citadel, I cannot help giving
you some Account of the Harbor, which is very
beautiful and commodious. Here is a very large
Square, where, by the Help of a certain Machine,
they easily unload all the Goods. Another good
Conveniency, and what contributes to render
this a very trading City, is, that besides the River
there are eight great Canals, by which Ships
may enter into the City. Yet notwithstanding
all these Conveniencies, the Trade of <i>Antwerp</i>,
tho' considerable, is not near so flourishing now,<!--175.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
as it was before the Civil Wars, and the new Opinions
in Affairs of Religion. 'Tis even astonishing
how this City could hold up its Head again
after the Calamities it suffer'd, even from
its own Sovereign, whose Troops in 1576,
burnt above 600 Houses in <i>Antwerp</i>; and while
the unfortunate Inhabitants were running, as it
were, into the midst of the Flames, to rescue
their best Effects, the <i>Spaniards</i> fell upon 'em,
and kill'd and drown'd near 10000. This terrible
Fire was the total Ruin of <i>Antwerp</i>; the Town-House
and several noble Palaces were reduc'd
to Ashes; and the immense Riches which they
contain'd were carry'd off by Plunderers, who
pillag'd for three Days, during which they committed
all manner of Outrages. Nevertheless,
this unhappy City, which had like to have been
buried for ever under its own Ashes, was rais'd
to Life again some time after by the Confederates,
who remain'd, as it were, its Sovereigns, till
1585, when the Prince of <i>Parma</i> took it from
them, after a Siege that lasted near twelve
Months, and was one of the most famous Sieges
that had ever been known before, as well upon
account of the few Troops the Duke of
<i>Parma</i> had to carry it on, which in all were but
1200 Men, as for that famous Dyke by which he
shut up the Harbor, and for the Bridge which
he laid over the <i>Scheld</i>.</p>

<p><i>Antwerp</i> remain'd under the Dominion of the
House of <i>Austria</i> from that Time to the Death
of <i>Charles</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>, when it was
oblig'd to receive a <i>French</i> Garison in the Name
of <i>Philip</i> V. whom the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i>, Governor
of the <i>Netherlands</i>, own'd for King of
<i>Spain</i>. But by the Battle of <i>Ramellies</i>, <i>Antwerp</i>
and a part of the <i>Netherlands</i> were reduc'd under<!--176.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the Dominion of the Emperor. During the
War that was enter'd into for the <i>Spanish</i> Monarchy,
a Battle was fought in the Neighbourhood
of <i>Antwerp</i>, near the Village of <i>Ekeren</i>, for
which both Parties sung <i>Te Deum</i>.</p>

<p>Having set out from <i>Antwerp</i> to pursue my
Journey to <i>Paris</i>, I pass'd thro' <span class="smcap">Mechlin</span><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
which is a very fine City, and the See of an
Archbishop, whose Revenue is very considerable.
The Metropolitan Church is dedicated to St. <i>Rambaut</i>.
This City is the Seat of a Great Royal
Council, which is, as it were, the Parliament of
the Country, and was establish'd by <i>Charles</i>
Duke of <i>Burgundy</i> in 1473. <i>Mechlin</i> is famous
for the Lace made there, which is finer and better
than any that is made in the other Towns of
the <i>Netherlands</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Mechlin</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Brussels</span><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, the Capital
of the Duchy of <i>Brabant</i>. This City stands
on the little River <i>Senna</i>, that falls into the
<i>Scheld</i> by the Canal of <i>Vilvorde</i>, and divides the
lower Town by several Canals that terminate in
the said Canal of <i>Vilvorde</i>, which is very convenient
for their Trade, whereof this City has
a considerable Share. There are several Manufactures
at <i>Brussels</i>, of which that of <i>Devos</i> for
Tapistry is worth seeing; that skilful Operator
having carried his Art to the utmost degree of
Perfection that the Curious can desire. The common
People of <i>Brussels</i> are more polite than in
any other City of the <i>Netherlands</i>; for most of
the Nobility of the Country come hither commonly
to pass the Winter; and there are few
Families of Note that have not a House here.<!--177.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>The Royal Palace is very large, and the Apartments
beautiful, tho' very old. This Palace
stands high above the City, being situate upon a
Hill, from whence there is a noble Prospect,
which is diversify'd by the Gardens, and the
Park that joins to the Palace, wherein there are
several very pleasant Walks, adorn'd with fine
Grottos and Fountains.</p>

<p>The Town-house is another very fine Building.
It stands in a Square, encompass'd with
Grand Houses, built after <i>Brussels</i> was bombarded
by the <i>French</i>, under the Command of the
Marshal <i>de Villeroy</i>, when this Quarter of the
Town in particular suffer'd very great Damage;
but it is since become the more agreeable by the
magnificent Houses built where the old ones
stood.</p>

<p>I left <i>Brussels</i> to go to Mons the Capital City
of <i>Hainault</i>, which stands upon a Hill, on the
Banks of the little River of <i>Trouil</i>, and is one of
the strongest Places in the Low-Countries. <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. besieg'd it in Person, and took it in 1691.
It was restor'd to <i>Spain</i> by the Peace of <i>Ryswic</i>,
but afterwards at the Death of <i>Charles</i> II. King of
<i>Spain</i>, it return'd as well as all the Low-Countries
under the Dominion of <i>France</i>. But at length after
the Battle of <i>Malplaquet</i>, it became subject to the
House of <i>Austria</i>. In this City there's a famous
Abbey of Nuns, which is a very honorable Retreat
for young Women of Quality, who are
Orphans, or don't care to be dependant on
their Parents. They wear the Habit of Nuns
in the Morning, to be present at the Office; but
in the Afternoon they dress like Gentlewomen;
and they make no Vow.<!--178.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>From <i>Mons</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Valenciennes</span><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>,
which City is a part of the Province of <i>Hainault</i>,
and the chief Town of <i>French Flanders</i>.
Its beautiful Fortifications display the same Magnificence
that was always observ'd in all the
Works erected in the Reign of <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
That Monarch besieg'd <i>Valenciennes</i> in Person,
in the Year 1677; and after having taken it by
Storm, caus'd a strong Citadel to be erected in
it at the Expence of the Inhabitants. This City
had been besieg'd by the Marshals <i>Turenne</i> and
<i>La Ferte</i> in the Year 1656; but Don <i>John</i> of
<i>Austria</i>, the Governor of the <i>Netherlands</i>, accompanied
by the Prince of <i>Condé</i>, who at that
time, bore Arms against the King, made them
raise the Siege; and in this Expedition the Marshal
<i>de la Ferte</i> was taken Prisoner.</p>

<p>The late Elector of <i>Cologne</i> liv'd at <i>Valenciennes</i>
when I was there, the Casualties of the War
having oblig'd him to quit his own Dominions.
I was introduc'd to that Prince by the Prince <i>de
Tingri</i>, when his Electoral Highness gave me a
favorable Reception, and told me that he knew
my Father; but I plainly perceiv'd by what he
said, that this Prince would have been as glad
to be in his City of <i>Bonn</i>, as in a Town of
<i>France</i>.</p>

<p>I stay'd at <i>Valenciennes</i> three Days, after
which I set out for <span class="smcap">Cambray</span><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. This City is
the Capital of the <i>Cambresis</i>, and one of the
strongest Places in <i>Europe</i>. They say its Original
is very ancient; for some Authors pretend,
that <i>Camber</i> King of the <i>Sicambri</i> was the Founder
of it. The Kings of <i>France</i> conquer'd it,<!--179.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
and were Masters of it a long while. After the
Death of <i>Charles</i> the <i>Bald</i>, it was for some time
a Bone of Contention between the Emperor, the
King of <i>France</i>, and the Earls of <i>Flanders</i>;
but the latter seiz'd it, and the Emperors afterwards
declar'd it a free City of the Empire.
<i>Francis</i> I. King of <i>France</i> granted it a Neutrality;
but the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. made himself
Master of it; and afterwards during the Revolutions
of the <i>Netherlands</i>, it fell under the Dominion
of the Duke <i>d'Alençon</i>, Brother to <i>Henry</i>
III. who restor'd it to the <i>French</i> by a Treaty,
which he concluded with <i>John de Montluc</i>, whom
King <i>Henry</i> IV. afterwards made Prince of <i>Cambray</i>.
Not long after this, the <i>Spaniards</i> took
it by surprize, and kept it till 1677, when Lewis
XIV. took it, and it has remain'd ever since in
the Possession of <i>France</i>, which Crown has considerably
augmented its Fortifications.</p>

<p><i>Cambray</i> has the Title of an Archbishopric,
which was erected in 1559, by Pope <i>Paul</i> II. at
the Request of <i>Philip</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>. The
Suffragans granted to this Metropolitan were the
Bishoprics of <i>Arras</i>, <i>Tournay</i>, <i>St. Omer</i> and <i>Namur</i>,
which were anciently Suffragan Sees to the Church
of <i>Rheims</i>. The Archbishop takes the Title of
<i>Duke of</i> Cambray, <i>Count of the</i> Cambresis, <i>and
Prince of the Holy Empire</i>. He that was the Archbishop
while I was there, was the illustrious M.
<i>de Fenelon</i>, a Prelate as venerable for his Piety, as
for the Delicacy of his Pen. The present Archbishop
is the natural Son of the late Duke of <i>Orleans</i>
the Regent, and was formerly Bishop and Duke
of <i>Laon</i>. This Prelate fully answers the vast
Hopes that were conceiv'd, from his good Qualities
in his Non-age. His Predecessor in this<!--180.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Dignity was the famous Cardinal <i>Dubois</i>, the
Minister of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you, that the City of <i>Cambray</i>
is also of great Note for the famous League that
was concluded between the Pope, the Emperor
<i>Maximilian</i>, <i>Lewis</i> XII. King of <i>France</i>, and
<i>Ferdinand</i> King of <i>Arragon</i>, against the Republic
of <i>Venice</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Cambray</i> I went to <span class="smcap">St. Quintin</span>, which
City is the Capital of the <i>Vermandois</i>, and is of
Note for the famous Battle of <i>St. Quintin</i>, call'd
also the Battle of St. <i>Lawrence</i>, because 'twas
fought on the 10th of <i>August</i>, in 1557. After
the Truce was broke between <i>Henry</i> II. King of
<i>France</i>, and <i>Philip</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Philibert-Emanuel</i>
Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, who was Governor of
the <i>Netherlands</i>, besieg'd the City of <i>St. Quintin</i>,
which was destitute of Troops, and moreover in
a very bad Condition. The Admiral <i>Coligni</i>
got into it with some Forces, which gave Time
to the Constable <i>de Montmorency</i> to pass the
<i>Somme</i> with the <i>French</i> Army under his Command,
and throw some Succours into the Town.
This was executed indeed, but with so much Precipitation,
that the Men who entered it were scarce
five hundred in number. The Constable perceiving
the Approach of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and his
Troops being moreover incumber'd with their
Equipage, endeavored to make his Retreat;
but the Duke taking advantage of his Incumbrance,
surpriz'd him between the Villages of
<i>Essigny</i> and <i>Rizerolles</i>, and charg'd him home
before he had Time to put his Men into Order
of Battle; and the Constable and his Son were
taken Prisoners, with a great many Persons of
Distinction. The Number of the Slain was even
greater than that of the Prisoners; and among<!--181.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the former was <i>John</i> of <i>Bourbon</i>, Duke of <i>Anguien</i>,
a Prince of the Blood Royal, and above
600 Gentlemen. The <i>Spaniards</i> Loss did not
exceed 500 Men. <i>Philip</i> II. in acknowledgment
for this Victory, made that extraordinary
Vow, which he afterwards perform'd, to build
the Monastery of St. <i>Lawrence</i> at the <i>Escurial</i>;
upon which a certain Ambassador of <i>France</i>,
when he was shew'd that stately Edifice, said,
<i>That <span class="f">Philip</span> must needs be terribly afraid when he
made so considerable a Vow</i>. After the Battle,
<i>St. Quintin</i> surrender'd to the <i>Spaniards</i>, who
kept it till the Treaty of <i>Chateau-Cambresis</i>, in
1559.</p>

<p>From <i>St. Quintin</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Compiegne</span>, a
City in the Diocese of <i>Soissons</i>, which is situate
on the West side of the <i>Oyse</i> and the <i>Aisne</i>. The
famous Maid of <i>Orleans</i> ow'd the Loss of her
Liberty to this City. For that illustrious Heroine
going to the Relief of <i>Compiegne</i>, which the
<i>English</i> had resolv'd to besiege, had the Misfortune
to fall into their hands, and was carried
Prisoner to <i>Roan</i>, where they burnt her for a
Witch. 'Twas at the Castle of <i>Compiegne</i> that
the Cardinal <i>de Richlieu</i> kept the Queen <i>Mary
de Medicis</i> a Prisoner, till that Princess found
Means to escape, and to retire to <i>Flanders</i>. I
have had the Honor already to tell you, that this
unfortunate Queen died at <i>Cologn</i>.</p>

<p>This same Castle was also for some time the
Residence of the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i>, after he
was ejected out of his Dominions by the victorious
Arms of the Emperor. The Court his Electoral
Highness kept here was so splendid, that
it did not look like the Court of a Refugee Prince.</p>

<p>Near <i>Compiegne</i> there's a very large Forest,
which renders the Neighbourhood of this City<!--182.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
very pleasant. There are fine Roads cut out in
this Forest, which render it very convenient for
Hunting.</p>

<p>The only considerable Place from <i>Compiegne</i>
to <i>Paris</i> is <span class="smcap">Senlis</span>; and that purely on account
of its being the See of a Bishop: for setting
aside its Situation, which is very agreeable, by
reason of the Neighbourhood of the beautiful
Forest of <i>Chantilly</i>, <i>Senlis</i> is a very trifling Place.
Near this City is the Abbey of our <i>Lady of
Victory</i>, which <i>Philip Augustus</i> caus'd to be built
as an Acknowledgment for the Victory he won
in Person at <i>Bouvines</i>, over the Emperor <i>Otho</i>
IV. and his Confederates, on <i>Sunday July</i> 27th,
1215; upon which very Day, his Son too won
another Battle over the <i>English</i> in <i>Anjou</i>. They
say that the two Couriers that were carrying the
News of each of the Victories, from the one Army
to the other, met at the very Place where now
stands the Church of this Abbey.</p>

<p>Betwixt <i>Senlis</i> and <i>Paris</i> there stands the little
Town of St. <span class="smcap">Denys</span>, famous for the magnificent
Abbey which gives Name to it. In this Church
are the Tombs of the Kings and Princes of
<i>France</i>, whose Mausoleums are of rich Workmanship.
Here is a Treasure also which contains
a great Number of very curious Pieces. The
Abbey of St. <i>Denys</i> has also given its Name to
the great Plain in which it stands. 'Twas in
this Plain that the famous Battle was fought between
the Catholics and Hugonots, in the Reign
of <i>Charles</i> IX. when the Constable <i>Montmorency</i>,
who at the Age of 83, commanded the Catholics,
was wounded, but gain'd the Victory over
the Heretics.</p>

<p>At my leaving <i>St. Denys</i>, I had at length
the pleasure of seeing what I had a long time<!--183.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
passionately wish'd for, I mean the famous City
of <span class="smcap">Paris</span><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, where I arriv'd about the beginning
of the Year 1712. I make no scruple to call it the
chief City of the World, as it is the Capital of the
chief Kingdom in Christendom. The Extent of
its Circumference, the Beauty of its Buildings, the
Multitude of its Inhabitants, the continual Arrival
and the Residence of Foreigners there, the
Variety and Plenty of Commodities of all sorts,
render it the finest City in the World; and on
those Accounts 'tis justly reckon'd as the Ornament,
the Soul and the Strength of the <i>French</i>
Empire. I was not willing however to make any
stay here at first, because of my Impatience to see
the famous Castle of <span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, so much talk'd
of at all Foreign Courts.</p>

<p>I had entertain'd so grand an Idea of this Palace,
and was so fully persuaded of its being all
over Gold and Azure, that at the first Sight the
Beauty of it did not strike me. The Entrance
to <i>Versailles</i>, as one comes from <i>Paris</i>, does not
set it off at all, tho' the Avenue that leads to it
is one of the most magnificent; but when one
comes up to the Castle, and turns about towards
this Grand Avenue, the two sumptuous Stables
on the sides of it form a Prospect, which gives a
sublime Idea of the Master of those stately Piles
of Building. The Front of the Castle, which
looks towards the Gardens is the finest; and on
that Side is the superb Gallery, which is the Admiration
of all Foreigners. What most surpriz'd
me at <i>Versailles</i> is the Inside of the Castle, which
if one examines it well, looks like several Castles
join'd together. The Royal Family, which was
still pretty numerous, was lodg'd there very
much at their Ease, each having their Guard-Chamber,
an Anti-Chamber, a Presence-Chamber,<!--184.png--><span class="pagenum">178</span>
a Bed-Chamber, and Great Closet and Wardrobes.
The chief Officers and Ladies attending
the Princesses were also commodiously lodg'd.
The greatest part of the Lords of the Court had
Lodgings too here, which were indeed pretty
much straiten'd for want of room, but very
convenient. In short, I was assur'd, that when
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. was at <i>Versailles</i>, about 20,000 Persons
lay every Night in the Body of this Castle,
and the Buildings in the Verge of it, the Apartments
and other Lodgings being so well laid out,
that all this great Multitude did not croud one
another.</p>

<p>The finest Pieces in the Inside of the Castle
are the Gallery and the Saloons that join to it.
The Walls are lin'd with Marble. Every Place
shines with the Works of the greatest Masters in
Gold and Brass, and with noble Pier-Glasses. I
have heard say, that before the War for the <i>Spanish</i>
Succession, all the Tables, Chandeliers and
Stands, which are now of Marble and gilt Frames,
were of Massy Silver; but the King converted
them into Money to help defray the vast Expences
of the Wars he was then engaged in. The
Cieling of the Gallery represents in several Pictures
the principal Actions of <i>Lewis</i> the XIVth's
Life; and is also adorn'd with Cartridges and
Gildings, which are remarkable both for their
Richness and their Elegance.</p>

<p>The Chapel is perfectly answerable to the Magnificence
of the Inside of the Castle. The Critics
indeed think 'tis too lofty for its Bigness; and
without pretending to much Skill in Architecture,
of which what I now say is perhaps a Proof, I
should readily subscribe to their Opinion. Indeed
a Man ought to be plac'd in the Pew from
whence the King hears Mass, to have a just View<!--185.png--><span class="pagenum">179</span>
of the fine Paintings with which the Cieling is
enrich'd; and than which there's nothing to be
seen that is finer or better fancy'd. The principal
Picture represents God the Father in all his
Glory, as fully as Human Weakness can conceive
it. This is a piece of Painting I am never
weary of admiring; and I found some new
Pleasure every time I look'd on it. The Cieling
is supported by noble Pillars of a white
Stone, as beautiful as Marble, which form a Gallery
that runs round the Chapel, of an equal height
all along with the King's Pew, and the Ballisters
are of yellow Copper and Marble. When one
looks down from the Pew, the Chapel seems too
low, and the Great Altar not high enough.
Opposite to the King's Pew, and exactly over
the High Altar, there's an Organ-Loft of a
very good Contrivance, where the King's Music
sits. 'Tis a very good Band; and those who
are nice Judges always admire the first Touch
they give to their Instruments, the Moment that
the King enters the Chapel to hear Mass.</p>

<p>I own to you, <i>Madame</i>, that I thought it
one of the finest Sights in the World, to see
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. enter the Chapel in all his Grandeur,
attended by the Cardinals and the Lords
of his Court. The Life-Guards and the Hundred
<i>Swiss</i> took up the Gallery and the Bottom of the
Chapel, and the Drums beat, and the <i>Swiss</i>
Fifes play'd till his Majesty was seated. On
Communion or Sermon Days the King went
down into the Chapel, and then the Pavement,
which is of very fine Marble, was cover'd all
over with noble Tapestry. When the King
receiv'd the Sacrament, a Praying-Desk was set
for him over-against the High Altar, and
then the Hundred <i>Swissers</i> were rang'd in two<!--186.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Rows, and the Courtiers encompass'd his Majesty.
During the Sermon the King's Chair of
State was plac'd over-against the Pulpit, and
the Princes and Princesses of the Royal Family
and Blood were seated in Folding Chairs, on
both sides of the King in the same Line. But
the Princes and Princesses very seldom assisted at
the King's Mass; and when they did, they
kneel'd leaning on the same Ballustrade that the
King did, but quite off of his Carpet.</p>

<p>The Gardens of <i>Versailles</i> may be rank'd among
the modern Wonders; and I don't believe
that the so much boasted Gardens of the
superb <i>Semiramis</i> were finer. For really, considering
the Statues, Vases and Water-works of
Marble and Brass, one wou'd think Pains had
been taken to ransac <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i> it self,
both ancient and modern, for its most wonderful
Productions on purpose to bring them to this
charming Place. These Gardens were plann'd
by the famous <i>Le Nautre</i>. At the end of the
Great Walk which fronts the Castle there's a
very spacious Canal. It forms a Cross to a certain
Distance, one side of which leads to the <i>Menagerie</i>,
and the other to <i>Trianon</i>. The <i>Menagerie</i>
is a very little House with only a few
Rooms, from whence the King may see the
rarest Animals of all sorts, which are kept there.
As for <i>Trianon</i> and its Gardens, one would not
think at the first View that they were made by
Man. The Whole is perfectly inchanting, and
a Person ever so little captivated with the strange
Tales of the Fairies, wou'd not scruple to think
this magnificent Structure the Master-piece of
those ingenious Work-women. The whole Building,
to outward Appearance, seems very small; but
when one examines the Inside of it, the Apartments<!--187.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
are both spacious and commodious. The
Outside of this Palace is partly hid by fine Groves;
what appears of it is fac'd with white Marble,
adorn'd with an Order of Pilasters of red Marble,
with Windows in form of Arches between
them. <i>Lewis</i> XIV. often retir'd to this charming
Solitude, to be shelter'd from the Importunities
of the Courtiers; and no body was admitted
to him but such Persons as his Majesty appointed.</p>

<p>A little League from <i>Versailles</i> there's <i>Marly</i>,
another Royal Palace; and which of all the Palaces
has the most pleasant Gardens, tho' those
of <i>Versailles</i> are by much more sumptuous. The
Great Cascade, which is all of Marble of various
Colors, makes a stately Appearance. When one
is at the Top of this Cascade, and looks toward
the Palace, one sees all the Gardens, and a Plain
thro' which the River <i>Seine</i> winds itself, having
on one side the Castle of <i>St. Germain en
Laye</i>; and on the other the Castle <i>de Maisons</i>,
belonging to the President of that Name, which
forms an admirable Point of View. <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. who was fond of <i>Marly</i>, condescended to
divest himself there of part of his Grandeur, and
did a great many Ladies of Quality the Honor
to make them sit down with him at Table. Thus,
<i>Madame</i>, have I given you a slight Sketch of
the famous Palace of <i>Versailles</i>, and its Neighbourhood.
I did not think it so proper to give
you an exact Detail of the Beauties one discovers
at every Step in this magnificent Palace.
You have undoubtedly seen a good Description
of them already, in the Books printed upon that
Subject. I shall now add a Word or two of the
Princes and Princesses of the Royal Family.<!--188.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not presume to say any thing of the
August Head of this illustrious Family, since it
wou'd require a more delicate Pen than mine to
treat so sublime a Subject with suitable Dignity.
All that I shall do my self the Honor to Say to
you of <i>Lewis</i> XIV. is, that if a good Mien was to
be the Merit for the Crown of <i>France</i>, this Great
Prince might have put in his Claim for it upon
that account, as justly as on the account of his
Birth. He was already advanc'd in years in
1712, when I had the Honor to see him; and
yet he had a nobler Air than any Man in his
Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, who became Dauphin
of <i>France</i>, by the Death of his Father, <i>Lewis</i>
XIVth's Son, who was the year before carried
off in a very few days by the Small-Pox at his
Palace of <i>Meudon</i>, was the first Prince in the
Kingdom next to the King. His Great Qualities
prognosticated that if he liv'd, his Reign
wou'd be very happy: Being Devout, without
neglecting any of the Duties of a Prince, he
had a way of reconciling the Retirement of a
Cloyster to the Bustle of a Court; and tho' he had
the Great Affair of his Salvation always at heart,
yet he thought, and justly too, that his
Practice of Piety ought not to exclude his Application
to the Affairs of State. He married a
Princess, whose great Qualities wou'd have made
the <i>French</i> happy, if an untimely Death had
not snatch'd her away in the Flower of her Age.
Her Name was <i>Mary Adelaide</i> of <i>Savoy</i>. I can
assure you, <i>Madame</i>, that I never saw one that
had a more Noble and Majestic Presence than
this Princess. And several Ladies that had the
Honor of being with her in private assur'd me,
that none could be more sprightly and gay. Her<!--189.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Youth made her fond of Pleasures; but yet she
never was forgetful of her Duties. She had an
extraordinary Respect and Regard for the King.
She went every Evening to Madame <i>de Maintenon</i>'s
Apartment when the King was there, and
after the Council was over, she put every thing
in practice that her gay Humor cou'd imagine
to divert him. The Princess had also a particular
Esteem for the Dauphin her Husband, and
as this Prince never fail'd of being at Mass, nor
at Vespers, or the Evening Prayers, the Dauphiness
always went with him, and very readily
made her Pleasures give place to her Duties.</p>

<p>I had not been long at the Court of <i>France</i>
when this illustrious Couple died within a few
days of one another. The first who paid that
Tribute to Nature was the Dauphiness. This
Princess fell sick at <i>Versailles</i>, soon after which
the Purples discover'd themselves; and at length
her Distemper appearing desperate, she was admonish'd
to prepare for Death: but this was Advice
she could not find in her heart to comply
with, it being a hard matter to renounce a voluptuous
Life; especially when supported with
the Hopes of being e'er long possess'd of one of
the first Crowns in the World. This Princess
died, as it were, in the Arms of the Duchess of
<i>Orleans</i>, who by her Desire never left her during
all the time of her Illness.</p>

<p>The King, who was very much afflicted for
her Death, set out immediately for <i>Marly</i>, whither
the Dauphin follow'd him. This Prince
knowing the Value of the Jewel he had lost, so
indulg'd his Grief that he sicken'd almost as soon
as he arriv'd at <i>Marly</i>, of the same Distemper
that had just depriv'd him of his Consort. He
received the Sentence of his Death with a Resolution<!--190.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
truly Christian; and in the Height of his
Distemper was often heard to put up this Petition,
<i>My God! save the King and Government</i>.
The Night he died he had a very great Desire
to hear Mass; and whatever they could say to
convince him that the Rules of the Church did
not allow it to be celebrated at that Hour, yet
he wou'd not take a Denial; so that as soon as
the Midnight Bell rung, Mass was said in his
Chamber, at an Altar that was put up at his
Bed's feet. After the Elevation of the Host,
the Dauphin was very much compos'd, and continu'd
praying to God till his Strength failing
him every Minute more and more, he gave up
the Ghost. This happen'd on the 18th of <i>February</i>
1712, six Days after the Death of the Dauphiness.</p>

<p>The King had need of all his Stock of Courage
to support so many Shocks one after another.
The Royal Family was in the utmost Consternation.
Those that were about the King
wou'd fain have persuaded him to retire elsewhere
a little while for Change of Air; but he
answered undauntedly, <i>That he was every where
in the Hands of God</i>; <i>and that therefore he
would continue where he was</i>. This great Prince
had soon after, another Trial of his Patience, by
the News he receiv'd of the Death of the Duke
of <i>Bretagne</i>, who upon the Decease of his Father
had been declar'd the Dauphin. This young
Prince died at <i>Versailles</i> the 8th of <i>March</i> 1712,
when he was but five Years old. There never
was a more sorrowful Scene than to see the Funeral
Pomp of this Year, which serv'd at the
same time for the Father, Mother and Son.</p>

<p>The only one that remain'd of this August
Stock was the Duke of <i>Anjou</i> now <i>Lewis</i> XV.<!--191.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
This Prince too, who was but a Child, was such a
poor Weakling all along, that no body thought
he would live; and he was at this time in such a
bad way, that the very Physicians despair'd of his
Recovery. Nevertheless he insensibly gathered
Strength, and now the <i>French</i> see their young
Monarch in a more vigorous State of Health
than they could have hoped for in his Childhood:
For this I believe they are oblig'd to the great
Care which was taken of this young Prince by
the Duchess of <i>Ventadour</i>, who was charg'd with
his Education, in which Post she acquitted herself
with all the Zeal that a Person could do, who
knew the Value of that precious Deposit which
was committed to her trust.</p>

<p>The next to the Throne after this young Prince
was the Duke of <i>Berry</i>, Brother to the Duke of
<i>Burgundy</i>. He was of a fair Complexion, and
for his Age a little too corpulent. He spent his
time chiefly in Hunting, and when the Chace was
over he us'd to go to his Duchess's Apartments
to game; for this Princess, after the Death of
the Duchess of <i>Burgundy</i>, kept an Assembly.</p>

<p>The last Prince of the Royal Family was the
Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, afterwards Regent of the
Kingdom; of whom I shall have occasion to
say more, when at the death of <i>Lewis le Grand</i>
he took on him the Government of the Kingdom
during the present Monarch's Minority.</p>

<p>The first People at Court next to the Princes
of the Royal Family, were the Princes of the
Blood. The chief was the Duke of <i>Chartres</i>,
now Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, by the Death of his Father
who was the Regent of <i>France</i> during the
Minority of <i>Lewis</i> XV.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Bourbon</i>, and the Counts <i>de
Charolois</i> and <i>Clermont</i> compos'd the <i>Condé</i> Branch.<!--192.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
The first of these Princes whom they call only
<i>The Duke</i>, was a tall portly Man, very free and
easy, but had the misfortune to lose one Eye
when he was a hunting by some small Shot that
scatter'd from the Duke of <i>Berry</i>'s Fowling-piece,
as he let fly at some Game.</p>

<p>The other two Princes were well-shap'd and
very fair, but being as yet very young, they
were as well as the Duke of <i>Chartres</i> in the hands
of their Governors.</p>

<p>The Prince of <i>Conti</i>, Son of him who was
formerly decked King of <i>Poland</i>, was the only
Prince of the second Branch of <i>Bourbon</i>.</p>

<p>These, <i>Madame</i>, were the Princes that then
composed the Court of <i>France</i>. I shall now do
myself the Honor to give you some account of
the Princesses according to their Rank, distinguishing
them as I have done the Princes, by the
Titles of Princesses of the Royal Family, and
Princesses of the Blood.</p>

<p>The first Princess of the Royal Family was the
Dauphiness, whom I have had the Honor to
mention to you.</p>

<p>Next to the Dauphiness, the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>
was first in Rank. This Princess was the
Daughter of the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, afterwards the
Regent. She resembled her Father very much
for her Wit, and had she not been a little too
bulky she would have been one of the most amiable
Princesses of the whole Court. I shall
have occasion to let you into this Princess's Character
presently.</p>

<p><i>Madame</i>, the second Wife of <i>Philip</i> of <i>Orleans</i>,
Brother to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. was the third Princess
at Court, during the Life of the Dauphiness.
Her Name was <i>Elizabeth-Charlotte</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>;
being the Daughter of the Elector <i>Charles-Lewis</i><!--193.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
by <i>Charlotte</i> of <i>Hesse</i>, and the last of the illustrious
Branch of the Palatine Family. The Court
I constantly pay'd to this Princess, to whom I
was moreover well recommended by the Electoress
of <i>Hanover</i> Mother to the King of <i>England</i>, enables
me to tell you some Particulars which will
give you a just Notion of her.</p>

<p>This Princess was very affable, yet not very
forward to grant her Protection. She talk'd a
great deal, and talk'd well. She lov'd especially
to speak in her Mother-Tongue, which she had
not forgot tho' she had been fifty Years in <i>France</i>,
for which reason she was overjoy'd to see her
Countrymen, and to correspond with them by
Letters. She was very punctual in writing to
the Electoress of <i>Hanover</i>, and to several other
Personages in <i>Germany</i>; and the Letters she
commonly wrote were not little Billets, but took
up twenty or thirty Sheets of Paper. Of these
I had a sight of several that would have been
worth publishing, and have not seen any thing
better writ in the <i>German</i> Tongue. In short,
this Princess did nothing but write from Morning
till Night. Immediately after she rose, which
was always about ten o'clock, she sate down at
her Toilet. From thence she went into her
Closet, where after having spent some time in
Prayer, she took Pen and Ink and wrote till she
went to Mass. After this was ended, she wrote
again till Dinner-time, which did not last long,
and then she fell to writing again till ten o'clock
at Night. About nine o'clock when she received
Company in her Closet she was found sitting at
a great Table spread with Papers, and there was
an <i>Ombre</i> Table just by it, at which the Marshal
<i>de Cleremhault</i>'s Lady and the other Ladies of
the Princess's Houshold used to play. Every<!--194.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
now and then the Princess cast an Eye upon the
Game, and would give her Advice and write at
the same time. At other times she convers'd
with those who paid their Court to her. I once
saw this Princess napping, and the Moment after
start out of her Sleep and write on. This, <i>Madame</i>,
was the common Life of the Princess
when she was at <i>Versailles</i>. Sometimes however
she went out a hunting with the King, dress'd like
an <i>Amazon</i>, and sometimes to the Opera. For
this Princess was very fond of Plays, so that after
the Death of <i>Lewis</i> XIV. when the Court came
to settle at <i>Paris</i> she often made the <i>French</i> and
<i>Italian</i> Comedians perform at the Theatre of the
Royal Palace.</p>

<p>As to Rank, never did any Princess support it
better than this. As she was punctual to the last degree
in requiring the Honors due to her, so she return'd
to every one the Honors that belong'd to
them. I heard her once talk very sharply upon
this head to the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>; and indeed
none but she durst have talk'd to that Princess
in such a Stile. It happen'd in <i>Lewis</i> XVth's
Minority that the Duchess of <i>Berry</i> came to her
one Evening in a Scarf. After she had been
there about half an Hour she ask'd Madame <i>de
Mouchy</i> what o'clock it was; whereupon the
Princess ask'd the Duchess of <i>Berry</i> what she
said to Madame <i>de Mouchy</i>. The Duchess made
her Answer, that she was going to the <i>Tuilleries</i>,
and therefore she ask'd what time of Night
it was. <i>How! to the</i> Tuilleries, said Madame;
<i>What are you going to take an Airing by the Light
of Flambeaus?</i> For, indeed, it was just Night.
<i>No, Madame</i>, said the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>, <i>I am
going to the King</i>. <i>To the King!</i> reply'd Madame;
<i>Pray excuse me for expressing my Surprize!</i><!--195.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
<i>What, go to the King, <span class="f">Madame</span>, in that Dress!
I thought you knew your Duty to him better: I beseech
you</i>, Madame, <i>do no such thing. Render to
the King the Respect that you owe him, and then
you will have a Right to challenge what is your
due from every body else.</i></p>

<p>The Duchess of <i>Berry</i>, who was not pleas'd at
this Reprimand, was going to reply, but Madame
interrupted her, and said, <i>No</i>, Madame, <i>nothing
can excuse you: Surely you may think fit to dress
your self as seldom as you go to the King, since I
that am your Grandmother dress my self every day.
Speak the Truth, and say 'tis meer Laziness that
hinders you from putting on your Clothes, which is
a Fault that becomes neither your Age nor your
Rank. A Princess ought to be dress'd like a Princess,
and a Chambermaid like a Chambermaid.</i>
The Duchess of <i>Berry</i> being not us'd to such
Lectures, was extremely mortify'd at being so
check'd, and upon this occasion she did what she
us'd to do when any thing was ever said that offended
her, and when Decency did not permit
her to make a haughty Reply; that is, she arose,
made a low Curt'sy, and went away. Madame
fell to writing again, but talk'd still of the same
Subject, and not without some Warmth. She
said, looking about to all the Company, <i>Was I
in the wrong, pray, to talk as I did to the Duchess
of</i> Berry? <i>What say you to it?</i> You will easily
suppose, Madame, that nobody open'd their Lips,
but while she was running on still in the same strain,
to the great Confusion of every Soul in her Closet,
the Princess of <i>Conti</i> came in, which gave a
Turn to the Conversation.</p>

<p>After <i>Lewis</i> XIVth's Death, Madame follow'd
the Court to <i>Paris</i>, where she resided in
the Winter, but commonly spent the fine Season<!--196.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
at <i>St. Cloud</i>. From thence she came very often
to the King's Apartment, us'd to be at the
Theatre, and return in the Evening to <i>St. Cloud</i>.
She had then with her <i>Mademoiselle</i>, now the Abbess
of <i>Chelles</i>, and <i>Mademoiselle de Valois</i>, now
the Princess of <i>Modena</i>. The other Princesses,
her Grandaughters, liv'd at <i>Paris</i> with the
Duchess of <i>Orleans</i> their Mother. This Princess,
tho' the Mother of the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>,
had not the Precedency of her, and when she
was at her Daughter's House she had only a
Folding-Chair allowed her, whereas the Duchess
sate in an Arm-Chair. The Duchess of <i>Orleans</i>
was the last of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>The first of the Princesses of the Blood was
the Princess-Dowager of <i>Condé</i>, <i>Anne</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>
Countess-Palatine, Daughter of <i>Edward</i>
Prince-Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>. She was call'd
only, Madame the Princess. She commonly resided
at <i>Paris</i>, where she liv'd a very exemplary Life
for her Piety and great Charity. She died the
23d of <i>February</i>, 1723, at seventy-five Years of
Age.</p>

<p>This Princess was Mother to the Duke of
<i>Bourbon</i> (that died in 1710) whose Wife <i>Louisa-Francese</i>
of <i>Bourbon</i>, the legitimated Daughter of
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. was, I can assure you, Madame, one
of the most beautiful Princesses of the Court;
and tho' already the Mother of eight Children,
it was much more natural to take her for their
Sister. With so much Beauty, she had also
Charms still more preferable; and all these external
Qualities were supported by a majestic Air,
and a Deportment which gain'd this illustrious
Princess Respect at the same time that her affable
and obliging Behavior procured her Love. She
had moreover a lively sparkling Wit, always sure<!--197.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to divert, whether in giving Merit its due Praise,
or whether by her delicate Raillery, she expos'd
the Ridicule of that Behavior, which notwithstanding
the good Taste of the Age had perhaps
made the Fortune of some fawning Courtier.</p>

<p>The next in Rank to that Princess was the
first Dowager-Princess of <i>Conti</i>, the legitimated
Daughter of <i>Lewis</i> XIV. The Air, Shape and
Beauty of this Princess, have made such a noise
in the World, that I believe, Madame, you are
not ignorant that she was reckon'd the tip-top
Beauty of the Kingdom; and really tho' she was
pretty much advanc'd in Years, she had still that
Air of Majesty and Modesty which partakes of
the Grandeur of her Father, and of the exemplary
Piety of her Mother in her latter Years. After
the Death of <i>Lewis</i> XIVth's Son the Dauphin,
this Princess was very much retir'd, so that I
never saw her any where but at <i>Madame</i>'s Apartments;
and since the Death of the King she
scarce appears any where at all.</p>

<p>The Princess of <i>Conti</i>, the second Dowager is
by Birth Princess of <i>Condé</i>. She is Mother of
the Prince of <i>Conti</i>, of <i>Mademoiselle de Conti</i>,
who died Duchess of <i>Bourbon</i>, and of <i>Mademoiselle
de la Roche-sur-Yon</i>. It may be said that
this Branch of <i>Bourbon</i> have had their share of
Sense and Virtue.</p>

<p>The Duchess of <i>Maine</i> and the late Duchess
of <i>Vendôme</i> were Sisters of the second Dowager-Princess
of <i>Conti</i>, and the Daughters of <i>Henry
Julius</i> Prince of <i>Condé</i>, and of the Princess-Palatine,
whom I have already had the Honor to
mention to you.</p>

<p>The Duchess of <i>Maine</i> is a Princess of real
Merit, and a great Wit. She degenerates in no
respect from the illustrious Blood of <i>Condé</i>. She<!--198.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
liv'd with more Splendor than any Princess of
<i>France</i>. She commonly resided at <i>Seaux</i>, a magnificent
Castle not far from <i>Paris</i>, and one of the
finest that I have seen, not only for its commodious
Apartments which are also richly furnish'd,
but for the extent of the Park in which there's
such an agreeable Variety of Groves, and of
Marble and Brazen Statues, as presents the curious
Spectator always with something new. It
may be said, that in her time the Pleasures had
fix'd their Residence in this charming Place.
There was a Resort from all parts to this Princess,
and People were glad to leave both the
Court and City, being sure of finding something
at <i>Seaux</i> better contriv'd than the common Representations
on the Stage; and indeed they were
never disappointed, the Duchess of <i>Maine</i> having
an exquisite Taste in such things; for she
lov'd the fine Sciences, and was a better Judge
than any body, of what they call Composures.
This illustrious Princess took a delight in bespeaking
Plays, and sometimes did not think it
beneath her to act a part in them her self. The
famous <i>Baron</i> and <i>Beauval</i> had often the Honor
of performing with her. Those who have frequented
the <i>French</i> Theatre know full well that
such a choice was a very evident Proof of that
Princess's Taste for good Declamation. After
the Comedy there was generally a Party for
Play, and then a magnificent Supper, after which
there was sometimes a Fire-Work, but most
commonly there was a Ball, at which there was
always a vast Number of Masks; yet the whole
was so well ordered, that there was plenty of

<p>These, <i>Madame</i>, were the Princes and Princesses
who form'd the Court of <i>France</i> when I<!--199.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
came thither, and I thought 'twas proper to give
you a Character of them before I mention'd the
Conduct I observ'd at my Arrival there.</p>

<p>I first got my self introduc'd to Madame, to
whom I was moreover recommended by the Electress
of <i>Hanover</i>, the King of <i>England</i>'s Mother.
This Princess, who always retain'd a particular
Regard for the <i>Germans</i>, receiv'd me with
even more kindness than she commonly shew'd
to those of that Nation. She did me the Honor
to introduce me to the King herself, one
Night after his Majesty had supp'd. This Prince
was in his Bed-Chamber, with all the Princes
and Princesses of the Royal Family. The King
remember'd my Name, and did me the Honor
to ask me, whether I was not the Son of one
<i>Pollnitz</i>, who had been at his Court from the Elector
of <i>Brandenbourg</i>? And upon my telling
him that I was his Grandson, he said to me,
<i>Indeed, you seem to me to be too young to be taken
for his Son</i>. His Majesty then ask'd me if I intended
to make any stay in <i>France</i>. I answer'd,
that I was so overjoy'd to find myself at the
Feet of the greatest of Kings, that I would do
my self the Honor to pay my Duty to him as
long as possible. The King seem'd to like my
Answer, and turning towards Madame, he said
to her, speaking of me, <i>He talks French well</i>.
He afterwards did me the Honor of a Salute,
and told me as he withdrew that he should take
a pleasure in doing me Service.</p>

<p>Next day Madame introduc'd me to the Duke
of <i>Burgundy</i> the Dauphin, and to the Dauphiness,
which illustrious Couple died some time after, as
I have had the Honor to tell you. Madame
also caus'd me to be introduc'd to the Duke and
Duchess of <i>Berry</i>, but neither of 'em said one<!--200.png--><span class="pagenum">194</span>
word to me. I was very well receiv'd by the
Duke and Duchess of <i>Orleans</i>. It was not easy
to see this Prince without loving him; for his
Affability supported by a most sparkling Wit,
and the most elegant Accomplishments, endear'd
him to all that had the Honor of Access to him.
This Prince constantly paid his Attendance at
Court, and had the greatest Respect for Madame.
He never miss'd a Day of waiting upon this
Princess. He went to her Apartments every
Night at half an Hour past eight, and play'd at
Chess there till the King's Supper-time; but this
Prince only sate down at the Game, and as he
went in and out he always kiss'd her Hand.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>France</i>, tho' very splendid by reason
of the number of Princes and Princesses of which it
consists, was nevertheless not so gay as I expected.
The Life at <i>Versailles</i> was the most uniform
in the World: The King's Hours were settled,
and he that had seen but one Day there had seen
a Year. The King rose at nine or ten o'clock.
The Princes and all the Courtiers attended his
Levee, and after he was dress'd he kneel'd down
to Prayers on a Cushion of Black Velvet, with his
Chaplains and the Bishops that were at his Levee,
kneeling also round him. When Prayers were
ended, the King went into his Closet, where
sometimes the Ministers came to speak to him about
Business, and in the mean while the Courtiers
walk'd in the great Gallery, thro' which the
King walk'd to hear Mass, and there all the
Courtiers waited to be seen by his Majesty as he
pass'd. I never saw a Nation more fond of paying
their Attendance at Court than the <i>French</i>;
for I have even seen many Courtiers, who thinking
the Prince had not observ'd them, stept
forwards into another Room, and then another,<!--201.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
till by chance his Majesty happen'd to cast his
Eyes upon them.</p>

<p>After Mass was over the King return'd to his
Closet; sometimes he held a Council and afterwards
din'd alone, at which time one might also
observe how the Courtiers strove to be seen by
him. The King eat with a good Appetite, nay
I thought he eat voraciously. His Dinner lasted
three Quarters of an Hour, and upon certain
Days there was Music. After Dinner, the King
went down by the Back-stairs, and took Coach
to go a hunting in the Park of <i>Versailles</i>, which
was full of small Game. He return'd about the
Dusk of the Evening, and went to Madame <i>de
Maintenon</i>'s Apartment, where there were only
a few of the old Courtiers, and generally speaking,
none but Ladies; as, Madame <i>de Caylus</i>, a
Cousin of Madame <i>de Maintenon</i>, and Madame
<i>de Dangeau</i>, who play'd at Cards with the King
when the Ministers were not there; for then, instead
of Gaming, Business was the Subject, and
there every thing was commonly settled. At
ten o'clock at Night, when word was brought
to the King that Supper was serv'd up, his Majesty
went to the Table, where the Princes and
Princesses always accompanied him. The Duchesses
were plac'd behind the Folding-Chairs of the
Princes, on both sides of the Table; and the
other Ladies of Quality stood on the Right hand
of the King's Arm-chair. His Majesty, after
making a Bow to the Princes and Princesses
and all the Ladies, sate down in his Chair, and
then the Princes and Princesses took their Seats,
as did also the Duchesses. The other Ladies of
Quality pass'd into a Salon just by, where they
were at liberty to sit down. The Supper lasted
no longer than the Dinner: The King talk'd<!--202.png--><span class="pagenum">196</span>
there but little, and sometimes he address'd himself
to <i>Madame</i>, or to the Duchess of <i>Orleans</i>;
but I never heard him speak to the Dukes of
<i>Berry</i> and <i>Orleans</i>, nor even to the Duchess of
<i>Berry</i>.</p>

<p>After Supper was over, the King, preceded by
the Princes, went into his Bed-Chamber, where
he found such of the Ladies as were not Duchesses,
to whom he put off his Hat, and then sate down
by the Ballustrade that was before his Bed, where
he stay'd till the Princesses and Duchesses were
enter'd into the Room. I observ'd that the old
Court-Ladies made a profound Curt'sy to the
King's Bed when they enter'd his Chamber,
which the young Ladies did not; for being perhaps
more puff'd up with their Youth and their
Charms, they did not think themselves oblig'd
to pay so much Respect. When the Duchesses
who had attended at Supper enter'd to the King's
Bed-Chamber, the King made an Obeisance to
them, as he did to the other Ladies; and then
the King preceded by the Princes, and followed by
the Princesses who had supp'd with him, went
into his Closet, to which the Princes and Princesses
of the Blood also repair'd. His Majesty
convers'd with 'em for a while, during which
the Duchesses and the other Ladies withdrew.
At length the King dismiss'd the Princes and
Princesses, and went to Bed. Then the Courtiers
separated, and the Generality retir'd. Some
went to the Duke of <i>Berry</i>'s Couchée, and others
to the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>'s. Those who paid their
Court to this Prince were well receiv'd by him.
For my own part I went thither as often as I
could, not so much to pay my Court to <i>Madame</i>,
as from a natural liking I had to this
Prince.<!--203.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, Madame, did the King pass his Life.
The Pleasures of the Courtiers were at best but
dull, Gaming being almost their whole Amusement.
The Assembly was commonly held at
the House of the Prince <i>d'Armagnac</i> of <i>Lorrain</i>,
Master of the Horse, where there was Play in
the Afternoon. Foreigners were perfectly welcome
to this Prince, as they were also to the Cardinal
of <i>Roban</i>. The latter liv'd very magnificently,
and at the Houses of these two Noblemen
you were sure to see the Prime of the Nobility
of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>When the Court was at <span class="smcap">Fontainbleau</span><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>,
'twas much more gay than it was when at <i>Versailles</i>,
where it may be said, that it shone in its
full Lustre. Nevertheless tho' <i>Fontainbleau</i> is
not near so magnificent, it has the Air of a Castle,
which <i>Versailles</i> has not. Moreover, Art and Nature
seem to have acted in concert towards forming
the magnificent Buildings which several
Monarchs have caus'd to be erected at <i>Fontainbleau</i>:
Whereas at <i>Versailles</i> Nature seems to
have had nothing to do, every thing being the
Work of Art, and too much adorned. Perhaps
I may be the only one of this Opinion, but
I always thought that the Magnificence at <i>Versailles</i>
was too general.</p>

<p>I was at <i>Fontainbleau</i> some time after the Conclusion
of the Suspension of Arms with the <i>English</i>.
The News of the Peace on the point of
being concluded, and the Victory at <i>Denain</i>,
seem'd to have restor'd to the Court such an Air
of Gayety as had not been known there for many
years. The Elector of <i>Bavaria</i> was there at
that time, and there was such Gaming at the
Duchess of <i>Berry</i>'s and the Duke of <i>Antin</i>'s, as<!--204.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
if they had no Sense at all of the public Calamities.
The Party was of twelve Cutters at <i>Lansquenet</i>,
who began with setting four Lewid'ors,
and at last stak'd Rouleaus of a hundred Lewid'ors
on a Card. I won seven hundred Lewid'ors
there one Night, in less than an Hour's
time, and the Duchess <i>de la Ferte</i> trick'd me
out of no less than a hundred, besides fourscore
that she borrow'd of me, and never paid me again.
Perhaps she thought 'twas the best way
to make herself amends for the Trouble she was
pleas'd to take upon her, of setting my Money
upon the Table, there being such a Croud of
Ladies round it that I could not get near it.</p>

<p>While the Court was at <i>Fontainbleau</i>, who
should come thither but Mr. <i>St. John</i>, since made
Lord <i>Bolingbroke</i>, to settle the Plan of the Peace
that was afterwards concluded at <i>Utrecht</i>. He
could not have been better receiv'd than he was
there if he had been a Sovereign Prince, for the
King himself had an extraordinary Regard for
him. I was one day to see his Majesty dine,
when there was to be Music, but as soon as it
struck up the King stopt it, by calling out aloud,
<i>I am informed that M. <span class="f">de St. John</span> dines
with the Duke of <span class="f">Antin</span>. Let my Music wait
on him there, and let him know that I send it to
him, and that I wish it may give him Pleasure.</i>
You will easily imagine, Madame, that all the
Courtiers, in imitation of the Monarch, strove
who should be most complaisant to the <i>English</i>
Minister, who for his part justly merited the
Regard that was paid to him.</p>

<p>The Court stay'd at <i>Fontainbleau</i> some time
after the Arrival of this Minister, and all the
while there was nothing but Merriment and a
continual Succession of Pleasures. The Hunting-Matches<!--205.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
were of the utmost Magnificence. The
Ladies were there either on horseback or in
Chaises in the Retinue of the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>
and <i>Madame</i>. So many fine Women mounted on
horseback all richly dressed, the King in a Chaise
attended by the whole Court on horseback, and
the sumptuous Hunting-Equipages to be seen all
at once in the pleasant Forest of <i>Fontainbleau</i>,
form'd one of the finest Sights that could be.
On the Days when there was no Hunting, the
King took the Air in an open Calash round the
great Canal, accompany'd by Ladies whose
Habits were the finest and of the most beautiful
Fancy that could be imagin'd. When
the Court return'd from their Airing there was a
Comedy or else a Drawing-Room at the Duchess
of <i>Berry</i>'s, where they play'd at <i>Lansquenet</i>.</p>

<p>At those times too when there was no Hunting
there were Assemblies at M. <i>le Grand</i>'s, and
several others of Quality. I observ'd that most
of the Nobility were more inclinable to be complaisant
at <i>Fontainbleau</i>, than at <i>Versailles</i>: If a
Man was ever so little known for a Person of
Quality, they freely furnish'd him with the
King's Horses for Hunting, which is scarce ever
practis'd but in <i>France</i> and <i>Lorrain</i>. Indeed I
have seen the same thing done at the Court of
<i>Bavaria</i>, but 'twas very seldom.</p>

<p>After I had follow'd the Court for some time
to <i>Versailles</i> and <i>Fontainbleau</i>, I went back again
to the famous City of <span class="smcap">Paris</span>. I no sooner arriv'd
there but I had a considerable Fit of Sickness,
which brought me almost to the Brink of
the Grave. I committed myself to the care of
the famous <i>Dutch</i> Physician <i>Helvetius</i>. This
skilful Doctor set me upon my Legs in a very
little time; and when I was able to go abroad, he<!--206.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
advis'd me to take a Walk in the Garden of <i>Luxembourg</i>,
which they cry'd up for the best Air in
all <i>Paris</i>. I did not fail to pursue the Doctor's
Direction, and observ'd indeed, that the Air I
breath'd in that Garden was very good for me:
But in a little time it had like to have prov'd
most pernicious to me. For one Morning as I was
walking there, I saw two Ladies coming a good
way off, in a Deshabillé, who had both a grand
Air, and a most noble Carriage. They were
footing it on the very Terrass where I was
walking; so that I sat down on a Bench to see
them pass by. I confess to you, that I thought
their Persons as lovely as their Undress was genteel
and noble. As they sail'd by me, one of
'em happen'd to drop her Handkerchief, which
I that instant snatch'd up and presented to her.
She receiv'd it in a very polite manner, and I
pass'd her a Compliment, to which she made a
witty Reply. By degrees we entered into a Conversation,
which tho' it held only a Quarter of
an Hour, cost me very dear; for I fell in Love,
and more deeply in Love than I can express
to you. The Ladies asked my Name. You
will imagine I did not put them to the trouble
of asking it twice; the rather, because I hop'd
that in requital they would tell me their Names:
But notwithstanding all my Intreaty they wou'd
not satisfy me. She that I was most enamour'd
with at the first View, bid me in very good <i>High-Dutch</i>
not to give my self any Uneasiness to
know who they were; as she was going away,
she said that I should not fail to see them again
if I made any stay at <i>Paris</i>. I gave her my
Hand and led her to her Coach, which seem'd
to be well lin'd. I also saw a Couple of lusty
Lackeys who were well clad. All this put together,<!--207.png--><span class="pagenum">201</span>
confirm'd me in the Notion I had conceiv'd,
that they were Ladies of Quality; or, at
least, in good Keeping. I wou'd have given
all the World to be inform'd exactly who
and what they were; but 'twas absolutely impossible
for me to make any Discovery. The
Lackey that I had with me being a <i>German</i>,
and even more a Stranger here than my self, was
upon that account an improper Person, for the
Management which is necessary for such Discoveries.
I remain'd therefore mortally uneasy, and
it had like to have made me as light-headed as I
was in the Illness from which I was but newly
recover'd. I did not fail to go to <i>Luxembourg</i>
Gardens every day, and staid there from nine
o'clock in the Morning till Night, excepting
only the little time it took me to go home to
Dinner. All these Jaunts forwards and backwards
lasted about a Fortnight, at the end of
which I found my self just as forward as I was
the first Day. At last, when I had given over
all Thoughts of being so happy as to find this
Fair-one out, I was surpris'd to see her at a
Place where I never dreamt of finding her.
One day as I waited upon the Ladies <i>de V&mdash;&mdash;</i>
and <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i> to the Play-house where <i>Cid</i> was to
be acted, and <i>Quinaut</i> the Elder began with
playing <i>Roderigo</i>; judge, <i>Madame</i>, how great
was my Surprize when I saw that the Heroine
of my Passion was also the Heroine of this
Play, in which she perform'd the Part of <i>Clymene</i>.
In all my Life I was never so confounded,
and began to question whether I ought to indulge
a Passion of that nature. I perceiv'd some
Reluctance in my Mind against attaching my
self to a Person whose Profession is rarely susceptible
of those nice Sentiments, which Persons<!--208.png--><span class="pagenum">202</span>
of Honor always demand in Love. But the
Course I took was really the same that a Boy
of nineteen years of Age wou'd have done; that
is to say, I acted the very contrary to what I
ought to have done. I foolishly indulg'd my I
Passion, so that I had scarce Patience to stay for
the Interval between the Play and the Entertainment,
before I went behind the Scenes, where
I found my Fair-one, with several Gentlemen
of my Acquaintance about her, whom I took
at first for so many Rivals; and as if it was not
Punishment enough to be in love, I must needs
be jealous too. I spoke to <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i>, (which was
the Name of this dissembling Creature) but I perceiv'd
that what I said put her into a Flutter; and
I observ'd that she was over and above complaisant
to a Gentleman of the Long Robe who
stood near her. I was not mistaken in my
Guess; 'twas <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i>, one of the Counsellors of
Parliament, who bore this Lady's Expences, and
at such a Rate too, as if he had been an Officer
of the Finances, rather than a Magistrate. I
was so vain as to think of supplanting this Lover,
or at least, if I could not quite non-suit him, I
flatter'd my self that I should put him to a Non-plus.
For this end I began to frequent the
Comedy, and soon had the Comfort to find
that my Love was not repaid with Ingratitude.</p>

<p>The Difficulty was to find a convenient Opportunity
of seeing one another; but Love and
Fortune soon pav'd the way for our Interview.
Young <i>Q&mdash;&mdash;</i>, the Sister of <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i>, who also
liv'd with her, happen'd to have the Small-Pox.
The Counsellor, who was extremely afraid of
the Consequence, immediately took <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i> from
those Lodgings, and gave her an Apartment in
the Hotel <i>d'Entragues</i>: But my comic Mistress<!--209.png--><span class="pagenum">203</span>
gave me notice of her new Quarters; and the
very same Day I hir'd a Chamber there too.
I took no body with me but one Domestic,
who was the Confident of my little Secrets;
and there, in spite of my troublesome <i>Argus</i>, it
was easy for me to see his Mistress, who would
have been glad to be mine, if I had been so
generous as he was, to give her 14000 Livres
a year. But I chose rather to go snacks with
him in the Favors which the Fair-one granted,
than to pay so dear for the Exclusion of a Rival.
The Counsellor, for his part, was not so indifferent,
and having a Mistrust, he left no Stone
unturn'd to find out the real Truth of the matter;
nor was it long e'er his Curiosity was satisfy'd.
Any other Person, not so deeply smitten
as he was, might have known what he had
to trust to for a Trifle of Expence; but this unbelieving
Gallant, who, perhaps, was also too
much conceited of his own Merit, and had too
great an Opinion of his Nymph's Virtue, to presume
to be jealous of her Honor upon slight
Appearances, try'd new Experiments. He gave
a Bribe to a Chambermaid, who made him see
enough with his own Eyes intirely to remove
those Suspicions which he had so fondly indulged.
In a word, he saw me with his dear Mistress; and
at a time too, when we should have least of all
thought of being seen together. What a Fury
the provok'd Lover was in, is easy to imagine,
Nevertheless he was so prudent as to dissemble
his Passion till I was retir'd to my own Chamber.
Then, like another <i>Roland</i>, he took a
Revenge for the Infidelity of his <i>Angelica</i> upon
every thing that happen'd in his way. He broke
and dash'd all to pieces; he tore off her Topknot,
and threaten'd no less than utter Destruction<!--210.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to all about him. To all this Noise the
Damsel return'd no Answer but Tears, which
at length wrought so far upon this outragious
Lover, as to pacify him: being then more
calm, he larded his severe Reproaches with the
softest Expressions; and taking the advantage
of her Foible, offer'd her to increase her Pension,
if she wou'd but promise him inviolable Fidelity.
The Fair-one swore that nothing should,
hereafter, lead her astray from her Duty; and in
a Flood of Tears she consented to receive 2000
Crowns Addition to her Pension, which made
it 20000 Livres a year. The Bargain was concluded
with great Joy on both sides; but yet
it was not strictly perform'd; for I continu'd my
Visits to the Damsel, till at length her Sister being
recover'd of her Distemper, Miss return'd to
her own House. The Difficulties that then occurr'd,
together with my own Fickleness, quite
cool'd my Passion, which it was the easier for me
to get rid of, because it was not in the least
founded in Esteem; and perhaps, had it not
been purely for the Pleasure of teazing that Limb
of the Law, I had withdrawn my Addresses
sooner.</p>

<p>My Amour with the fair Comedian did not
sequester me from Company; and I will venture
to say, that I made a tolerable Figure in a
Country where every body that is not <i>French</i>
passes readily for a Barbarian. Several Gentlemen
who saw how graciously the King receiv'd
me at <i>Versailles</i>, were eager to pay me their
Respects; particularly the Duke <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i>, first
Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, made me such
a Compliment as I cannot easily forget. I became
acquainted with this Nobleman at <i>Versailles</i>.
He accosted me with the utmost Civility<!--211.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
in the Great Gallery, the very Day after
I had been introduc'd to his Majesty, and told
me that I had good reason to be pleas'd with
the Reception which the King gave me; but
much more with what he said when I was
withdrawn; which was, <i>That of all the Foreigners
who had been introduc'd to him, no
body had saluted him with a better Grace and
a more easy Air than the Margrave of</i> Anspach
<i>and me</i>. The said Duke made a Proposal to
me for my entring into the Service of <i>France</i>;
and also promis'd me that I should be made a
Colonel, if I would turn <i>Roman Catholic</i>. I
thank'd him for his obliging Offers; but assur'd
him, that Interest should never make me alter
my Religion. I was also at that time full
of the Prejudices of the Protestants against the
Catholics; moreover, I was of an Age not
mature enough for serious Reflections: for I
thought of nothing in the world but my Pleasures;
and indeed, how could a Man of my
years help abandoning himself to them, when
all the Kingdom, <i>Paris</i> especially, breath'd an
Air of Gayety, which there was no withstanding?
<i>France</i> saw that Peace which she had long
wish'd for, on the point of being concluded;
her late Losses had been expung'd by the Victory
at <i>Denain</i>, and other Advantages which
the <i>French</i> Troops obtain'd, not only by the
raising of the Siege of <i>Landrecy</i>, which the
Allies had invested, but by the taking of <i>Marchiennes</i>
and <i>St. Amant</i>. The Allies began therefore
to think of a Peace, and the <i>English</i> were at
last willing to consent to it. I have already
had the Honor to acquaint you, that my Lord
<i>St. John</i> was come to the Court of <i>France</i> to
have a Conference upon the Articles of the<!--212.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
so much desir'd Peace; and that he was receiv'd
there as a Man who came with the
most important News that 'twas possible for
them to receive.</p>

<p>As soon as that Minister was return'd to <i>London</i>,
the Congress was open'd at <i>Utrecht</i> for a Peace;
and <i>France</i> and <i>England</i> mutually sent their
Ambassadors to one another. The Duke <i>d'Aumont</i>
was appointed to go in that quality to
the Court of <i>England</i>; and before he departed,
the King gave him the Order of the Holy
Ghost. This Nobleman was perfectly welcome
to the Court-Party at <i>London</i>, which was
desirous of Peace; but was an Eye-sore to the
opposite Party, who hated to hear the mention
of it. The <i>French</i> Ambassador was insulted,
and treated with such Outrage, that his House
was set on fire, and the Loss thereby sustain'd
was very considerable; the said Duke having
borrow'd the richest Furniture of several Persons,
which was entirely burnt. The Duke of
<i>Orleans</i> thereby lost a noble Suit of Hangings,
and several very scarce Pictures.</p>

<p>The Person who was sent to <i>France</i>, as Ambassador
from the Court of <i>England</i>, was the
Duke of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, whose Reception by the
King, the Court and the Kingdom was sufficient
Demonstration how well they lik'd the
Commission which he came to negotiate. This
Ambassador kept no very great Table at the
Court of <i>France</i>; nor was his Equipage very
gay. He was indeed a Nobleman of very great
Merit, but of a mean Presence; for he was
blind of one Eye, and exclusive of that Defect no
body would hardly have taken him for a Nobleman,
if he had not been adorn'd with the Order
of the Garter. He had his Duchess with<!--213.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
him, who was an <i>Italian</i> Lady by Birth, and
Sister to the famous <i>P&mdash;&mdash;</i>, so well known in <i>England</i>
for his Extravagancies and his tragical Exit.
The Duke of <i>Shrewsbury</i> was betroth'd to her
in <i>Italy</i>, and married in <i>England</i>. This Duchess
appear'd at the Court of <i>France</i> with the most
Foreign Air in the World. The Duchess <i>d'Aumont</i>
was to have introduc'd her to the King
and the Princesses; but as she was at that time
indispos'd, she desir'd Madame <i>de Chatillon</i> to
perform the Office for her. The King receiv'd the
Ambassadress with great Marks of Distinction;
and she was afterwards introduc'd to <i>Madame</i>,
where she found a numerous Company that
came thither out of meer Curiosity; and there
it was that I had the Honor of seeing her.
She seem'd at first in such Confusion, as if
she had never liv'd in any Court, but by degrees
she took courage. She talk'd a great
deal, and talk'd well.</p>

<p>The same Night the Duchess of <i>Shrewsbury</i>
was with the King at Supper, where she was
plac'd in the Rank of the Duchesses, exactly
behind the Duke of <i>Berry</i>. She talk'd a great
deal to this Prince, tho' she had only a Glimpse
of him once before at the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>'s
Apartment. All the Supper-time she did nothing
but twitch him by the Sleeve, to advise
him not to eat so much. Every body was very
much surpriz'd to see this Familiarity of her's; and
I observ'd that the Duke of <i>Berry</i> was not a little
confounded at it. I forgot to mention one Circumstance
wherein I thought the King was over and
above polite. As he came to the Table he pass'd
by the Duchess of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, without seeing
her; but just as he was going to sit down, M. <i>de
Livry</i> the Chief Steward acquainted him, that<!--214.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the Ambassadress of <i>England</i> was come to his
Supper. Upon this, the King return'd that instant
to the Place where she was, and said to her,
<i>That he had pass'd her without saluting her, because
he did not see her; and that, he thought
she was so fatigu'd with the Visits she had made
in the Day that she was retir'd</i>. The King also
desir'd her to go and repose her self; but she
made her Excuse and said, <i>That 'twas impossible
to have the Honor of paying Duty to so great a
King as his Majesty, and to complain of Fatigue</i>.</p>

<p>The Duchess of <i>Shrewsbury</i> was much of the
same Temper as her Lord the Ambassador: She
did not care for expensive Living. I remember
that one day when I was at the Palace
of <i>Soissons</i>, where she lodg'd, the Duchess <i>de
----</i>, who was a very gay Lady, wou'd fain
have engag'd the Ambassadress to give a Ball:
for this purpose she signify'd what a general
Melancholy there was all over <i>France</i>, on account
of the Death of the Princes, and a War
of several years continuance; and said, every
body expected that the Duke of <i>Shrewsbury</i>,
who was come over to <i>France</i> to bring Peace,
would also be inclinable to procure the Return
of those Pleasures which so many Calamities had
banish'd. But it all avail'd nothing; for the
Ambassadress made answer to the Duchess,
that she should be very glad to see a general
Mirth at <i>Paris</i>; and that she thought the
Duke of <i>Shrewsbury</i> had brought the <i>French</i>
such important News, as wou'd have put an
end to all Sadness for the past Misfortunes,
without expecting him to procure other Pleasures.
'Twas to no purpose therefore to insist
any longer on a Ball from that Quarter.<!--215.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>You will undoubtedly be surpriz'd, Madame,
when you hear who was the Person that gave the
first Ball, instead of the Ambassador of <i>England</i>.
'Twas I that reviv'd <i>Paris</i> out of that fatal Lethargy,
into which it seem'd to be fallen. I gave
a Ball at <i>Carneaux</i>, or rather <i>Mesdames de la
M&mdash;&mdash;</i> <i>D&mdash;&mdash;</i> and <i>de V&mdash;&mdash;</i> gave it for me.
These Ladies having in form desir'd me to give
a Ball, I immediately excus'd my self, on the consideration
that as I was a Stranger it did not become
me to set a Pattern for Entertainments, especially
for a Peace which could be of no farther
Advantage to me, than as it would indeed enable
me to live more to my Satisfaction, in a Country
where it had been long wish'd for. Moreover,
there were other Reasons much of the same nature
as those that govern'd the Duke of <i>Shrewsbury</i>,
which made me grudge the Expence of a
Ball that I foresaw would be very chargeable.
My Arguments had some weight with the Ladies;
but a Ball they were resolv'd to have, and
therefore they made a Proposal to me, that if I
would give them but ten Lewid'ors there should
be a Ball, and I should have nothing else to do
but to give out at the Opera and the Comedy,
that there would be a Ball such a day at <i>Carneaux</i>.
This I did not fail to do, and wherever I came
I found People very well inclin'd to be present
at the Assembly. The Ladies on their part hir'd
the great Hall of the <i>Carneaux</i>, which they
caus'd to be very finely illuminated, and having
provided a very good Concert of Music there, they
caus'd the Ball to be open'd by their Waiting-Women
and Valets de Chambre. I supp'd with
the Ladies that Evening, and ingenuously own'd
to them that I did not very well know what Effect
a Ball of that sort would have at <i>Paris</i>.<!--216.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
After a good deal of joke upon it we went
thither as soon as ever we had supp'd, and I confess
that in my Life I never saw more Maskers.
They crouded one another from the very Gate
of the Court into the Hall, where the People were
ready to faint for the very Heat, and did not
know whom to apply to for a drop of Water:
Every body rav'd against the Ball, and against
the Person that gave it. But by good luck they
did not know whom they were oblig'd to for
such an Entertainment. Mean time I had the
Precaution to provide some Refreshments for the
Ladies in my Company, and they were not ill
bestow'd. This Ball drew me in to give ten or
a dozen other Entertainments of the like kind,
and altogether as unprovided of Refreshments.
Yet notwithstanding the general Thirst complain'd
of for want of Liquor, and the Curses
that I heard them utter against the <i>Undertaker</i>,
there was always a vast Croud of Masqueraders.</p>

<p>Thus, Madame, did I pass my time at <i>Paris</i>,
I kept the greatest and the gayest Company, and
I had pretty good Fortune at Play, which, together
with what was remitted to me from home,
put me in a Condition to live there like a Prince.
I made fresh Acquaintance every day, and they
gave me fresh Pleasures, till I receiv'd News
which troubled me very much, <i>viz.</i> the Death
of our King <i>Frederic</i> I. which happen'd on the
15th of <i>February</i> this Year, and was occasion'd
by one of the saddest Accidents that could have
fallen out. 'Twas the Queen herself who in one
of those Vertigo's, to which she had been for
some time past subject, frighten'd the King so
that he never recover'd it. It happen'd thus:</p>

<p>The Queen had for a long while given herself
up to more than ordinary Devotion, and to a<!--217.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
rigid Life not very agreeable to her natural Temper.
But the Princess thought 'twas the best
Course she could take, to stop the Mouths of
those who had been so audacious as to give out
that before her Marriage she was not always the
Fondest of Retirement. The recluse and self-denying
Life she led after Marriage, made her
subject to Vapors, which ended in Frenzy, the
Fits whereof were terrible. The King was not
acquainted with her unhappy Disorder for a long
time, till at last the Queen being one day in a
more outragious Fit than ordinary, was so strong
as to get loose from the Ladies that had the Care
of her Person, and being but half dress'd, with
her Hair dishevel'd, she went thro' a private Gallery
to the King's Apartment. As she enter'd it
she broke a Glass-Door, by which she cut both
her Hands and Arms; and in this bloody pickle
rush'd in upon the King like a Fury, and abus'd
him with such Reproaches as would never have
enter'd into the head of the poor Princess, if she
had been well. The King, who was at the same
time somewhat indispos'd, was taking a Nap in
an easy Chair; but he started out of his Sleep,
and imagin'd himself in the hands of a Ghost,
every thing contributing to confirm him in that
Notion. For the Queen having her Hair flying
about her Temples, and no Clothes on but an
Under-Petticoat, and a quilted Waistcoat of <i>Marseilles</i>
Linnen, and her Arms and Face being
moreover of a Gore-Blood, the King fancy'd her
to be the <i>White Woman</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, and did so much believe
that this Apparition was a certain Presage of his
approaching Dissolution, that it threw him the<!--218.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
same Instant into a Fever, which oblig'd him to
take to his Bed, and he never recover'd it. This
Prince lay ill for near six Weeks, during which
he had the Consolation to see how dear he was
to his Subjects; for one day as he thought himself
a little better, so that the Physicians began to
have hopes of his Recovery, he caus'd himself
to be carry'd towards a Window, from whence
he saw the whole Square full of People, who
were offering up Vows to Heaven for his Life.
This was so moving a Scene to him, that the generous
Prince could not refuse a Tribute of Tears
for the Tenderness of his People. But their
Prayers were not heard; and his Majesty died
at <i>Berlin</i> with a Constancy and Courage worthy
of him, after having given excellent Instructions
to his Son the Prince Royal.</p>

<p>This young Prince was heartily griev'd for the
Death of the King his Father, and as soon as he
had receiv'd the first Homages of the Margraves
who were the late King's Brothers, and of the
whole Court, he shut himself up in his Apartment
where he abandon'd himself to that Lamentation
which he had reason to make for the
Loss he had sustain'd. The Person that notify'd
his Death to the Courtiers who crouded the Apartments,
was M. <i>de Printz</i>, the Grand Marshal.
They say, that when this Nobleman made
his appearance to proclaim the melancholy News,
it so seiz'd him that he could only say, <i>The King,
the King, the King!</i> his redoubled Sighs discovering
the rest that his Tongue had not power
to declare.</p>

<p>The King's Funeral Obsequies were very
magnificent. In the Streets, from the Palace to
the place of Interment, several Regiments of
Soldiers were drawn up in a Line on each<!--219.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
side. The new King accompany'd the Convoy,
and when the Corpse was deposited in the Royal
Vault he went out of the Church, and mounting
on horseback put himself at the Head of the
Troops which made three Discharges of small
Arms, and at the same time the Cannon were
fir'd from the Ramparts. Thus, Madame, were
the last Devoirs paid to <i>Frederic</i> our First King.</p>

<p>As to the Queen, the Physicians were of Opinion
that her Native Air would be of service
to her, and therefore she was carry'd to her Mother's
Seat at <i>Grabau</i> in <i>Mecklemburg</i>, where she
still remains, but without any Hopes as yet of her
Recovery.</p>

<p>After the Death of <i>Frederic</i> I. the King his
Son dismiss'd the whole Court, the three Companies
of Life-Guards were broke, and the Guard
of the hundred <i>Swiss</i> sent home to their own
Country: In short, every thing assum'd a new
Face. I saw, and was really mortify'd to see,
that there was nothing more for me to hope for in
my own Country. Nevertheless, tho' I thought
I should have broke my Heart the first Moment
that I receiv'd the melancholy News, my Sorrow
was of no long duration. I had not, indeed, a
very splendid Fortune to be my Comfort, but I
was so young that I presum'd to think I should
never come to want. Besides, my Birth was
some Relief to my Mind; and to tell you the
plain truth of the matter, as Things stood with
me at that time, I was quite in love with <i>Paris</i>,
which was reason good enough why I should
not devote myself long to Melancholy.</p>

<p>Happening to be at the Fair of <i>St. Germain</i>,
I there contracted Love for another Mistress. I
had no reason to be asham'd of the choice I then
made, because I might have hop'd to have been<!--220.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
possess'd of every thing that was capable of fixing
a Man of Gallantry. I abandon'd my self
intirely to this new Amour, and as I was naturally
fond of Expence, I laid out such a Sum that
all my Friends were startled at it. My Equipages,
Clothes, Liveries, <i>&amp;c.</i> were all of the utmost
Magnificence, and the frequent Presents
that I made were very rich. But I was soon reduc'd
to a Necessity of making very serious Reflections
upon my past Conduct; tho' I had no
body to blame but myself; for as to Mademoiselle
<i>de S&mdash;&mdash;</i> (which was the Name of the Angel I
ador'd) she would certainly have been well enough
pleas'd with a Lover less profuse, so that
with a little Oeconomy I might have made a gay
Figure at <i>Paris</i>: But my new Passion would not
suffer me to think so close of my Finances,
which were now so much disorder'd that I saw
no Remedy, except to return to my own Country:
But I was so uneasy to think of going away,
that I was very loth to fix on a day for my Departure.
Mean time my dear Mistress and her
Mother both press'd me with Tears in abundance
to undertake a Journey so necessary; the one
wishing it for my own sake, and the other for
the sake of her Daughter; for the good Mother
was as eager after Money, as the Daughter was
disinterested. At length the melancholy Day
being come, I set out from <i>Paris</i> without bidding
Farewel to any one Friend whatsoever except
<i>Madame</i>, and the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, because I
hop'd to be back again speedily. I left all my
Servants behind, except only one Domestic who
was privy to all my Affairs.</p>

<p>The Day that I set out I arriv'd about five
o'clock in the Evening at <i>Roye</i> in <i>Picardy</i>,
where I was told I could not proceed farther<!--221.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
for want of Post-Horses, the Duke of <i>Ossuna</i>
who was gone Ambassador of <i>Spain</i> to the Treaty
at <i>Utrecht</i>, having taken them all up. I resolv'd
therefore to go on with those that brought
me to <i>Roye</i>. I halted at very sad Quarters, at a
place betwixt <i>Roye</i> and <i>Peronne</i>. The first thing
I did was to go to Bed, and really need enough
I had of Rest; for my Head was so confus'd
with a thousand different Thoughts, that I felt
my Brains work almost as if I had been light-headed.
But when I was in Bed 'twas much
worse with me, I still indulg'd Melancholy.
One while I wanted to go back again to <i>Paris</i>,
whither my Love call'd me strongly. On the
other hand, I was sensible of the sad Necessity
of pursuing my Journey. In short, Swarms of
different Inclinations succeeded each other; but
at last, after a long debate with my self, I resolv'd
to return to <i>Paris</i>. The time when I made this
noble Resolution was about two o'clock in the
Morning. I got up that Moment, and call'd for
my Valet. As he lay in another part of the
House which was separate from my Apartment,
I thought 'twas better to go my self and awake
him, than to lose my time in calling for him. I
went out of my Chamber accordingly, but as ill
luck would have it, I had not observ'd, or rather
the confusion I was in made me forget that my
Chamber-Door open'd into a Gallery that run
round the House. This Gallery was so lately
built that they had not time to put Rails to it,
so that before I had gone two steps I had the finest
tumble that ever I made in my Life. I
fell from the Gallery into the Yard, and by good
luck upon a heap of Dung, otherwise I might
have been wounded, if not kill'd; so that all the
harm I had was the surprize to find my self<!--222.png--><span class="pagenum">216</span>
sinking in a Matrass as offensive as 'tis possible
to conceive. My greatest perplexity was then to
contrive how to get out of it, and to find the
way back to my Chamber: But the Night was
so dark, and I was so little acquainted with the
House where I lodg'd, that I despair'd of getting
out without Help; I began then to call out lustily
for my Valet. But the Rascal never heard me,
and indeed I was inform'd soon after, that he had
been drunk, so that his Liquor had plung'd him
into a profound Sleep. Seeing that I had to do
with one that was as deaf as a Post, I thought
fit to call out aloud for <i>Mary</i>, <i>Catherine</i>, <i>Joan</i>,
and other Names, hoping that there was some
Servant-Maid in the House, whom one at least
of these Names would fit: Nor was I deceiv'd,
for one of the Maids came to my Assistance, but
the Wench taking me for a Spirit ran away in an
instant, with a great Cry of <i>Jesu-Maria</i>. I was
then terribly mortify'd: At this rate I plainly
saw I should be forc'd to spend the rest of the
Night in the Dunghill, and to wait with patience
till the whole Family was risen. What made
me the more apprehensive of the Consequences
of this Disaster was, that tho' we were got into
the Summer Season, yet the Nights were cold,
and I had nothing over my Shirt but a Taffeta
Night-Gown. I began again therefore to call and
baul so loud, that at length some of the Family
ran out to see what was the matter; but like the
Servant-Maid they all took me for a Ghost come
to haunt the House, and were afraid to come
near me. At length, all this Noise awak'd my
Valet, who ran out in his Shirt. He imagin'd
at first that there had been a Design to murder
me, but when I bid him put the Horses in my
Chaise, he thought I was crazy; and indeed, I<!--223.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
was pretty far gone that way. I repeated my
Order to get my Chaise ready, that I might be
gone that instant. My Valet, who had scarce
recover'd from the Surprize he was in at my giving
such an Order, said, <i>Alas, Sir, be easy; 'tis but two
o'clock in the Morning yet, at five you shall be gone.</i>
I told him, that he was a Fool, and that go I
would. But he, like other Skipkennels who are
apt to be fancy if their Masters treat them with
any degree of Familiarity, refus'd point-blank
to obey me. He said that I had no Consideration,
that because I could not sleep my self I
hinder'd others from sleeping; that I roll'd along
the Day in an easy Chaise, whereas he rode generally
upon very sorry Horses; that in short he wanted
Rest, and that he would not set out till he had
two Hours more Sleep, and had a good Breakfast.
I was like to have been in a Passion, but
saw 'twas to no purpose, and therefore we split
the Difference; he compounded with me not to
go to Bed again, and I gave him leave to take
his Breakfast. When he thought fit to make an
end, I got into my Chaise, and order'd the
Postillion to strike into the Road for <i>Paris</i>.
Then my Valet imagin'd indeed that I was crack-brain'd;
he said I was wrong, and that we must
turn into the Road to the <i>Netherlands</i>. I order'd
him to hold his tongue, and go on. The
poor Boy being confirm'd more and more in his
Notion that I was Kite-headed, was wonderful
uneasy, and at every Stage came with a sorrowful
Countenance to the side of my Chaise to know
how I did, and if I wanted any thing. At
length I arriv'd at <i>Paris</i>, where all that knew of
my Departure were startled to see me return'd so
soon. I feign'd my self very much out of order,
and that I came back again for fear of a Fit of<!--224.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Sickness, in which case I chose to be at <i>Paris</i>
rather than any where else. But no body would
believe me, for they thought that some Love-Affair
at heart was the sole cause of my returning
in such a hurry. I stay'd three Days at <i>Paris</i>,
but did not go once to <i>Versailles</i> for fear of <i>Madame</i>,
who was a Princess that did not love such
Frolics, and I for my part did not love Reprimands,
and therefore I thought it best to keep out
of her way. Mean time the very same reason
that determined me the first time to take a Journey
to my own Country still subsisted, and at
last I quitted <i>Paris</i> in good earnest, tho' I was
resolv'd to be absent as little a while as possible.</p>

<p>I went the common Road to <i>Brussels</i>, and
from thence through <i>Breda</i> and <i>Gorcum</i>, to <i>Utrecht</i>;
having a desire to see in what state the
Congress was, which was then held at that
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breda</span>, which is a Place of Strength, situate
on the River of <i>Mercke</i>, is part of <i>Dutch Brabant</i>,
and one of the most considerable Towns
in the <i>Netherlands</i>. This City and its Territory
has the Title of a Barony, and has had several
Masters. The last Owners of it were the Princes
of <i>Nassau</i>, who acquired it in 1404, by <i>Eagelbert</i>
of <i>Nassau</i>'s Marriage with <i>Joan</i> the only
Daughter of the Lord of <i>Leck</i>, who was Sovereign
of <i>Breda</i>. <i>Henry de Nassau</i> founded the
Castle in this Town, and the Tomb of <i>René</i> is
still to be seen in the Collegiate Church of St. <i>Peter</i>,
which was founded about the Year 1303.
This City suffer'd very much towards the latter
end of the sixteenth Century, during the Wars
for Religion. 'Twas at first seiz'd by the Confederates,
who form'd the Republic of the United
Provinces. The Prince of <i>Parma</i> took it<!--225.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
from them the 18th of <i>June</i> 1581; but Prince
<i>Maurice</i> of <i>Orange</i> made himself Master of it in
1590, by means of a Boat laden with Turf, under
which he had caus'd about threescore Soldiers to
be conceal'd, who made themselves Masters of
the Castle, and thereby gave the Prince an Opportunity
to take the Town by Capitulation.
They tell a very remarkable Story of one of the
Soldiers that was hid in that Boat, <i>viz.</i> That
having a Necessity of coughing, he desir'd one of
his Comrades to kill him outright, for fear that his
impertinent Cough should discover the Stratagem.
This Soldier richly deserv'd to have his Name
transmitted to Posterity; for sure a <i>Roman</i> could
not have said a more gallant Thing, and an Instance
of inferior Courage to this would perhaps
have been rewarded with a Statue. Some Years
after the Reduction of <i>Breda</i>, the great <i>Spinola</i>
General of the <i>Spanish</i> Forces, besieg'd and took
it after a Siege, or rather Blockade of eleven
Months. 'Twas a fourth time besieg'd by <i>Frederic-Henry</i>
Prince of <i>Orange</i>, who took it after
a Siege of four Months, and then it came into
the hands of the <i>Dutch</i>, who have remain'd Masters
of it ever since, and have considerably augmented
its Fortifications; and as the Place is situate
in very Marshy Ground, they have erected
Sluices there, by means of which they can easily
lay all the neighbouring Country under Water.
For the rest, this is not one of the best built
Cities in the <i>Netherlands</i>, and were it not for its
Ramparts would be a very inconsiderable Place.
The King of <i>Prussia</i>, by virtue of his Pretensions
to the Succession of <i>William</i> III. King of <i>England</i>,
adds to his Titles that of <i>Baron of Breda</i>.<!--226.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Having pass'd through <i>Gorcum</i>, which I
thought a Town of very little consequence, I
came to <span class="smcap">Utrecht</span><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, which is one of the most
noted Cities in the <i>Netherlands</i>, and gives Name
to one of the seven Provinces, whereof it is the
Capital. It was formerly a Bishop's See, and the
Bishops were Sovereigns of the Province, and
Princes of the Empire. The Dukes of <i>Brabant</i>
and <i>Cleves</i>, the Counts of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Guelderland</i>,
and other Sovereigns to the number of
twenty-eight, were Feudataries to its Bishop.
The Emperor <i>Charlemain</i>, that great Founder of
Bishoprics, annex'd so Many Prerogatives to this
with a View of engaging the Bishops to act with
Zeal for Conversion of the <i>Pagans</i> who possess'd
a Part of the Neighbouring Countries. <i>Philip</i> II.
erected this Bishopric into an Archbishopric in
favor of <i>Schenck</i> of <i>Tautenbourg</i>; but he did not
enjoy the new Dignity long, for at the same
time that this Country revolted from <i>Spain</i>, the
Protestant Religion was introduc'd into it, and
the Archbishop was expell'd. <i>Henry</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>
was the last Bishop who was Sovereign of this
Country, but his Subjects rebell'd against him and
turn'd him out. This Bishop implor'd the Protection
of <i>Charles</i> V. to whom with the Consent
of his Clergy and States he transferr'd the Temporal
Dominion of the Country in 1528, and
from thence he was translated to the Bishopric of
<i>Worms</i>. The famous Union of the seven Provinces,
to which the Establishment of the Republic
is owing, was concluded at <i>Utrecht</i> the
13th of <i>January</i>, 1579.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Utrecht</i> is famous also for the
Birth of Pope <i>Adrian</i> VI, in 1459. They say
this Pontiff was of mean Extraction, and was<!--227.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
only oblig'd to his own Merit for his Advancement.
The Emperor <i>Maximilian</i> trusted him
with the Education of <i>Charles</i> his Grandson.
He was afterwards sent to <i>Spain</i> with the Title
of Ambassador to King <i>Ferdinand</i>, who gave him
the Bishopric of <i>Tortosa</i>. Upon that Monarch's
Death he shar'd the Regency of <i>Spain</i> with the
Cardinal <i>Ximenes</i>, and afterwards remained sole
Viceroy of that Kingdom. He was made a
Cardinal the first of <i>July 1517</i>, by Pope <i>Leo</i> X.
and chose Pope the ninth of <i>January 1522</i>.</p>

<p>While I am thus making Digressions in speaking
of the City of <i>Utrecht</i>, you will also permit
me to tell you that this City gave birth to the
famous <i>Anna-Maria Schuurman</i>, that learned Lady
who spoke <i>Latin</i>, <i>Greek</i>, <i>Hebrew</i>, the <i>Syriac</i>,
<i>Chaldee</i>, <i>Italian</i>, <i>Spanish</i>, and <i>French</i> Languages
as fluently as the <i>Low Dutch</i>, which was her
Mother-Tongue. She also knew how to paint
in Miniature, and to engrave both with the Graving
Tool and the Diamond upon Copper and Glass.
Queen <i>Christina</i> of <i>Sweden</i> did her the same Honor,
as <i>Alexander</i> formerly did to <i>Diogenes</i>, for she
went to pay her a Visit, and was surpriz'd at the
Beauty of her Performances. This most ingenious
Artist of her Sex died in 1678, at 71 Years
of Age.</p>

<p><i>Balderic</i> of <i>Cleves</i> the fifteenth Bishop of <i>Utrecht</i>,
caus'd this City to be encompass'd with
Walls; and <i>Charles</i> V. built its Castle, which
has at present nine Bastions, two Half-moons, and
a Hornwork. They say that the great Church
dedicated to St. <i>Martin</i>, was built in the Year
630 by King <i>Dagobert</i>; and after it was destroy'd,
together with all the other Buildings
in the City by the <i>Normans</i>, <i>Adelbolde</i> the 19th
Bishop caus'd it to be rebuilt and consecrated in<!--228.png--><span class="pagenum">222</span>
1024, in presence of the Emperor <i>Henry</i> II. and
twelve Bishops. It was ruin'd a second time,
but was magnificently rebuilt. There's a very
fine Tower at the Entrance 388 Foot high, from
whence fifteen or sixteen Towns may be seen
distinctly.</p>

<p>There's a better Air at <i>Utrecht</i> than in the other
Towns of <i>Holland</i>, the Ground it stands on
being much higher, and by consequence not so
marshy. This Town, which is situate upon the
old Channel of the <i>Rhine</i>, is incompass'd with a
fine fruitful Plain, and has charming Walks in
the Neighbourhood, which are not inferior to
those at the <i>Hague</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> were at one time Masters of this
Place, but on the 13th of <i>November</i> 1673, it reverted
to its lawful Sovereigns. When I arriv'd
here I heard that the Peace was just sign'd by the
Plenipotentiaries of <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i> on the one
part, and by the Ministers of <i>England</i>, <i>Portugal</i>,
<i>Prussia</i>, <i>Savoy</i> and <i>Holland</i>, on the other part.
The principal Conditions were, That <i>Philip</i> V.
should remain in possession of the Crown of
<i>Spain</i>, on condition nevertheless that he should
renounce the Succession to the Crown of <i>France</i>,
for himself and his Descendants: That <i>England</i>
should have <i>Gibraltar</i> in <i>Spain</i>, and <i>Port-Mahon</i>
in the <i>Mediterranean</i>: That <i>Dunkirk</i> should be
demolish'd: <i>France</i>, by the way, was very loth
to consent to the ruin of a Place which had already
cost her several Millions, and requir'd a
considerable Expence moreover to demolish. The
Elector of <i>Brandenburg</i> was recogniz'd King
of <i>Prussia</i>, both by <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>, and had
even the Title of <i>Majesty</i> given him, which
<i>France</i> never us'd to allow to the Kings of <i>Denmark</i>
and <i>Poland</i>. To the King of <i>Prussia</i> was<!--229.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
also yielded what he before possess'd in <i>Spanish
Guelderland</i>, as an Equivalent for the Principality
of <i>Orange</i>, which that Monarch yielded to
<i>France</i>. The Duke of <i>Savoy</i> was own'd King of
<i>Sicily</i>, and he obtain'd some Places in the <i>Milanese</i>.
The King of <i>Portugal</i> remain'd peaceable
Possessor of the Conquests which he had
made during the War. The <i>Dutch</i> got least of
all by the Peace, and perhaps they repented that
they did not accept of the Terms offer'd them
at <i>Gertruydenberg</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as I arriv'd at <i>Utrecht</i>, I did not fail
to make a Visit to the Ambassadors of <i>Prussia</i>,
who were the Count <i>de Denhoff</i>, the Count <i>de
Metternich</i>, and the Marshal <i>de Biberstein</i>. They
receiv'd me with all the Civility possible, and presented
me to all the Foreign Ministers. I found
at this City the Countess Dowager of <i>Wartemberg</i>,
who was lately come hither. The Count
her Husband, who died at <i>Francfort</i>, desir'd
upon his Death-bed that his Corpse might be
carried to <i>Berlin</i>, which was perform'd with
a good deal of Pomp. They say, that the late
King, who was very fond of him, as I have
already had the Honor to mention to you, wou'd
needs see his Funeral Convoy; and as it pass'd
before the Windows of his Castle he could not
refrain shedding Tears. Perhaps he then repented
that he had disgrac'd that Minister on such
slight Pretences; and perhaps too, the melancholy
Spectacle put him in mind of that unavoidable
Coast, on which both the Majesty of
Kings, and the Magnificence of Courtiers, will
at last be run ashore.</p>

<p>The Countess of <i>Wartemberg</i> was more undaunted.
She was far from indulging any mortifying
Reflection; but on the contrary, was<!--230.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
glad to find her self in possession of a very great
Estate; and gladder still to think that she was
uncontroulable. She left <i>Francfort</i> where she
had resided ever since her Husband's Disgrace;
and thinking that too melancholy a Place to
spend her Life in, she made choice of the City
of <i>Utrecht</i>, as the most gay of any that she knew.
She soon had an Intrigue or two upon her
hands; and when I arriv'd, I heard that the
Chevalier <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i> was her Bosom Friend.
This Gentleman was newly set out for <i>Versailles</i>,
with a Commission to carry the News of the
Peace. I was not much concerned whether I
made any Visit to the Countess; for I observ'd
that all of our Court who were then at <i>Utrecht</i>,
were shy of her to such a degree, that I did not
care to be the only one that shew'd any Regard
for her. But tho' I had resolv'd not to visit
her, I happen'd to fall in her Way. This
Lady had brought a <i>French</i> Gentlewoman with
her, whom I knew very well at <i>Berlin</i>; and as
she had Wit at will, I had a mind to renew
my Acquaintance with her, the rather because
I had a Curiosity to know a little of the Countess's
History. The first time I paid her a Visit she
made me an Offer to carry me to see the Countess
of <i>Wartemberg</i>; which I refus'd in such a
manner that she did not insist upon my going.
But she thought fit to tell the Countess that I
was lately come to <i>Utrecht</i>; that I had paid her
a Visit; and that she thought I perfectly resembled
the Chevalier <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i>. There needed
no other Motive to set the Countess agog to
see me; and she desir'd her Gentlewoman to
bring me to her. But notwithstanding all her
Persuasion, I peremptorily refus'd it. At last, as
I was making a Visit one day to the Gentlewoman,<!--231.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
who should bounce into the Room where
I was, but the Countess <i>de Wartemberg</i>. She
said, that tho' I scorn'd her so much as not to
make her a Visit, she had resolv'd to come and
see me. I was going to reply, but the Countess,
without giving me time to speak, told me,
that she thought me alter'd much for the better;
that no two drops of Water were more like than
I, and the Chevalier <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i>; and that in
short we perfectly resembled each other even
in the Tone of our Voice: But by Madam <i>de
Wartemberg</i>'s leave, there never were two People
more unlike. The Knight Commander was
a handsome well-set Man, which you know,
Madame, is a Character I never had the Vanity
to affect; and I thought every part of the Countess's
Compliment so extraordinary, that in truth,
a Scholar just come from the College could not
have been more dash'd than I was. I made an
Answer, 'tis true, but to tell you frankly, I knew
not what I said. I gave her my Hand, and led
her to her own Apartment, where she still descanted
upon the mighty Resemblance betwixt
the Chevalier and me. In fine, I think I may
venture to say, without giving my self an Air as
if I was the Darling of the Fair Sex, and without
passing in your Opinion for a Coxcomb, that
'twas my own fault I was not taken, in Body and
Soul, for the Chevalier; but I was so fortunate
as to be disintangled by a Valet de Chambre, who
came to acquaint her of the Arrival of M. <i>Menager</i>
the third Plenipotentiary of <i>France</i> at the
Congress, to whom I had Obligations for bringing
me out of this Scrape. This kind of Visit
made me take proper Measures to prevent any
more such, for the little time I had to stay in
this City.<!--232.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>From <i>Utrecht</i> I went to <i>Wesel</i>, and from thence
thro' <i>Westphalia</i> to the Duchy of <span class="smcap">Magdebourg</span>.
The City of this Name was formerly an Archbishopric,
erected by the Emperor <i>Otho</i> the Great
in favor of the <i>Vandals</i> newly converted, but
by the Peace of <i>Westphalia</i> the whole Country
was seculariz'd with the Title of a Duchy, in favor
of the <i>Brandenburg</i> Family, in Exchange for
that part of <i>Pomerania</i> which was yielded to the
<i>Swedes</i>. There are few Towns in <i>Germany</i> that
have suffer'd so many Revolutions as <i>Magdebourg</i>.
This City was put under the Ban of the Empire
in 1553, by <i>Charles</i> V. for refusing Submission
to his Orders, for it was then in open
Rebellion, so that the Elector <i>Maurice</i> of <i>Saxony</i>
was sent to reduce it. The Siege lasted a whole
Year, the Elector not being very much in haste
to push on the Conquest. As this War was undertaken
purely for the Destruction of the Protestant
Religion, which this City had embraced;
the Elector, who was himself a Protestant,
thought by spinning out the Siege to regain the
good Opinion of those of his Religion, who were
uneasy to see him support the Interests of the
Emperor and the Catholics. The Elector however
made them easy, by promising the Protestants
of <i>Magdebourg</i>, that he would join them
in the War against the Emperor, immediately
after the Surrender of the Place. Matters were
transacted on both sides with very great sincerity.
The Place surrender'd, and the Elector
entered it not as a victorious Prince, but rather
as an Ally who brought Relief to it. He made
use of the Garison to reinforce his Army, and
then declar'd War against the Emperor, on pretence
that the Religion and Liberty of <i>Germany</i>
were in danger.<!--233.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>A Change of this nature was so extraordinary,
that the Emperor could not expect it: For this
Prince had himself promoted the Elector of <i>Saxony</i>
to the Dignity he possess'd, after having depriv'd
the unfortunate <i>Frederic</i> of his Dominions; and
for so considerable a Present he might very well
hope the Elector would have made him grateful
Returns. The Emperor therefore was so far from
thinking himself oblig'd to be on his Guard for
fear of Surprise, that he imagin'd himself in a
State of perfect Security, when the Elector of
<i>Saxony</i> had like to have surpriz'd him at <i>Inspruck</i>
the Capital of <i>Tirol</i>. The Emperor knew nothing
of the Plot, till he was on the point of
being made Prisoner; and 'twas with much ado
that he escap'd, for he was at that time ill of the
Gout, and oblig'd to leave both his Equipage
and Domestics behind him. He would upon
this occasion have given the Prince <i>John-Frederic</i>
his Liberty, but this Prince was loth to abandon
him in this Misfortune, and accompany'd
him into <i>Carinthia</i>, twenty-eight Leagues from
<i>Inspruck</i>, where the Emperor made his Retreat.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Magdebourg</i> was a very great Sufferer
in the War, which is commonly call'd, <i>The
War of thirty Years</i>, because during that Term
<i>Germany</i> was ravag'd on all sides. <i>Tilly</i> the Emperor's
General besieg'd it in 1631, when 'twas
taken by Storm, and all the Inhabitants put to
the Sword. A Fire also had a part in its Destruction,
and committed such Ravage that
<i>Magdebourg</i>, which was one of the finest Cities
in <i>Germany</i>, was intirely reduc'd to Ashes. The
Burghers indeed had no body but themselves to
blame for their Misfortune, for General <i>Tilly</i>
would not have treated them so severely if they<!--234.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
had not refus'd an advantageous Capitulation, of
which he made them an Offer some days before
the Storm.</p>

<p>But since this Town has been in the hands of
the <i>Brandenburg</i> Family, the Electors have taken
care to fortify it so well, that it would now be a
hard matter to take it. The late King caus'd a
Citadel to be built here, which is separated from
the City by the <i>Elbe</i>. The present King has
added considerable Works to it, which are remarkably
substantial and magnificent. His Majesty
has also caus'd a very fine Arsenal to be
built in the Great Square, which tho' not very
large, is stor'd with a considerable number of
Cannon and other Arms. On the Right hand
of this Square is the Great Church, formerly the
Cathedral, a <i>Gothic</i> Building, where meets the
Chapter which is still subsisting, tho' Protestant;
and according to ancient Custom, none are admitted
into it but Men of Quality.</p>

<p>The Situation of <i>Magdebourg</i> is very fine,
having an Outlet on all sides to spacious Plains,
that are very fruitful in Corn. The <i>Elbe</i>, which,
as I have said, separates the Citadel from the
Town, renders its Commerce also very easy with
<i>Hamburg</i>, <i>Saxony</i> and <i>Bohemia</i>, for which reason
several Merchants are settled here who have
noble Houses. And since the King has transferr'd
the Regency of the Country hither from
<i>Hall</i>, the Town grows every day finer, so that
it may now be reckon'd one of the most beautiful
Towns in the two Circles of <i>Saxony</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Magdebourg</i> in my Way to <i>Berlin</i> I
pass'd thro' <span class="smcap">Brandenburg</span>, which is a City on
the River <i>Havel</i>, that was built by M. <i>Branden</i>,
a Prince of <i>Franconia</i>. 'Twas heretofore a Bishopric,
but now the whole Country is seculariz'd,<!--235.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
and makes a part of the <i>Marquisate</i> of <i>Brandenburg</i>.
Here is a considerable Trade, and the
King keeps a Garison in it, consisting of a Battalion
of the tall Grenadiers. You have so often
seen the Regiment of which this Battalion is a
part, that 'tis needless to commend it to you farther
than to observe, that 'tis perhaps the finest
Regiment in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>I did not stay at <i>Brandenburg</i>, because I would
be the sooner at <span class="smcap">Berlin</span>. On the day that I arrived
there I was so tir'd with having walk'd all
Day and Night, that I kept my Bed till the Evening,
when I had the Honor to wait on the
Queen, the King having been gone a few days
before to <i>Potzdam</i>, Her Majesty kept her Chamber,
and had not been out of it since her last
Lying-in, when she was deliver'd of the Princess
<i>Charlotta-Albertina</i>, who died the Year following
on the 10th of <i>June</i>. I was so coldly receiv'd by her
Majesty, that I had no reason to hope for favor at
Court, or at least with her Majesty. But the Margravines
receiv'd me with all the Civility possible.
The Margravine-Dowager especially assur'd me
that she would continue that Protection with
which she had always honor'd me.</p>

<p>As to the City of <i>Berlin</i>, it had not yet dry'd
up its Tears for the Loss it had lately sustain'd,
by the Death of <i>Frederic</i>. 'Tis true the King
his Son gave great hopes, but the thorough
Change he had made in his Court, caus'd the late
King to be lamented. The new Monarch thought
of nothing but keeping up a numerous Army,
and that he might do this without laying a Burden
upon his Subjects, he dismiss'd all his Court,
and the intire Houshold of the King his Father,
so that there was nobody at Court but the Ministers.
Most of the Persons of Quality who<!--236.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
lived heretofore at <i>Berlin</i>, were retir'd either to
their Estates or their Governments, which made
the City a most melancholy Place to stay in, and
all these Alterations convinc'd me that there was
nothing for me to expect in this Country. I
therefore resolv'd to settle all my Domestic Affairs
with the utmost speed, designing to return
forthwith to <i>Paris</i>. Before I went thither, I
made a Trip to <i>Zell</i>, in order to examine the
Accompts of a Person I had deputed as my Attorney
to receive the Deeds of my Mother's Estate.
But to my sorrow, my Mother had by
her Will devis'd the greatest part of her Estate
to the Children she had by her former Husband,
so that what I could lay claim to was far short
of what I promis'd my self.</p>

<p>From <i>Zell</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Hambourg</span><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, purely to
see that City. I had travel'd thither once before,
but was then so young that I was not in a Capacity
to take notice of any thing in this City
worthy of Remark. <i>Hambourg</i>, which is one of
the best Towns in <i>Germany</i>, is a part of Lower
<i>Saxony</i>, being situate upon the <i>Elbe</i> a few Leagues
from the Mouth of that River, which is a great
Conveniency to its Trade. Before it was erected
into a Republic 'twas a part of <i>Holstein</i>, on the
Territory of which it was built; and therefore
it had frequent Quarrels with the Dukes of <i>Holstein</i>,
and the Kings of <i>Denmark</i>, who are the
Sovereigns of <i>Holstein</i>. The latter, as well as
the <i>Swedes</i>, have attempted several times to make
themselves Masters of <i>Hambourg</i>, but have been
repuls'd as often as they came before it: For
this City is not easy to be reduc'd, because it has
noble Ramparts and very strong Out-works, and
it also takes care to be well provided with Artillery,<!--237.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and a good Garrison. Moreover, 'tis always
sure of the Protection of the Families of
<i>Brandenburg</i> and <i>Brunswic</i>, it being so advantagiously
situated, that 'tis the Interest of both,
that no Power whatsoever should take it.</p>

<p><i>Hambourg</i> is also very considerable on account
of the Wealth of its Inhabitants, who are almost
all Merchants, and much of the Temper of the
<i>Dutch</i> Merchants, very greedy of Gain and
thrifty. Their greatest Delight is so have Gardens
at the City-Gates, pretty much in the Taste
of those of <i>Holland</i>. The Wives of the great
Merchants are as much confin'd at <i>Hambourg</i>, as
the Women of Quality are at <i>Venice</i>, but I observ'd
they were only pent up from Foreigners.
A Man may pass his time very well in this City,
where there are several Persons of Quality to see,
who make their Visitors perfectly welcome. The
Walks in and about this City are charming, and
especially that on the Ramparts is a noble one,
there being a double Row of Trees which forms
an agreeable Covert, and from whence there's a
Prospect finely diversify'd by noble Houses, Gardens,
Woods, Meadows, <i>&amp;c.</i> in the midst of
which one sees the Rivers <i>Elbe</i> and <i>Alster</i>, which
both together yield a charming View. The River
of <i>Alster</i> comes into the Town and forms a
Basin very like a great Pond, which has a fine
Kay on the sides of it planted with several Rows
of Lime-Trees, between which there's a very fine
Walk.</p>

<p>Near <i>Hambourg</i> lies the Town of <span class="smcap">Altena</span><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.
The King of <i>Denmark</i> gave it this Name to banter
the Deputies of <i>Hambourg</i> who made Remonstrances
to him against his building this
Town too near to theirs, and in their Discourse<!--238.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to the King about the Town said several times,
<i>Sie ist al te na</i>, which in the Language of the
Country signifies, <i>it is too near</i>. The King taking
particular Notice of the Monosyllables <i>al te
na</i>, said to the Deputies that he could not excuse
himself from carrying on the Town which he
was building, and that all he could do to oblige
them was to order it to be call'd by the Name
of <i>Altena</i>, which they themselves had given it.
And indeed, a more significant Name could not
have been put upon this Town, for 'tis situate
just at the Gates of <i>Hambourg</i>, and is a part of
<i>Danish Holstein</i>. It was formerly a priviledg'd
Place for Bankrupts, and for all that had committed
any Crime in <i>Hambourg</i>. But the present
King of <i>Denmark</i>, rather than this Town
should continue any longer in the Enjoyment of
a Privilege which fill'd it with Knaves and Vagabonds,
delivers up Malefactors to the Magistrates
of <i>Hambourg</i> whenever they reclaim
them.</p>

<p><i>Altena</i> is remarkable for the Multiplicity of
Religions which are there publickly exercis'd.
I believe, that excepting <i>Amsterdam</i>, there is not
a Town in <i>Europe</i> where there are so many Sects;
but few of 'em are allow'd a Church. The Neighbourhood
of this Town to <i>Hambourg</i>, and its Situation
moreover upon the <i>Elbe</i>, does great Prejudice
to that City. 'Tis now several years since
<i>Altena</i> was burnt by the <i>Swedes</i>, under the Command
of the Count <i>de Steinbock</i>; when they scarce
allow'd Time to the Inhabitants to make their
Escape; so that they had the Grief to be Eye-Witnesses
of the burning of their Houses and
Goods, and several Old Men, and a number of Infants
perish'd in the Flames. I found <i>Altena</i> in
that sorrowful State when I first went thither;<!--239.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
but upon a Review of it since, I see that 'tis rebuilt
in such a manner, that 'tis now a finer and
more flourishing Town than ever. After four
or five days Stay at <i>Hambourg</i> I set out, and never
did any body go off at a more proper Time;
for in a few days after it, the Plague discover'd
it self in the City; upon which it was shut up,
and its Communication forbid with any other
Place.</p>

<p>I return'd thro' <i>Zell</i>, where I made no manner
of stay, to <span class="smcap">Aix-la-Chapelle</span><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, an Imperial City,
on the Confines of the Duchies of <i>Juliers</i> and
<i>Limbourg</i>. 'Tis encompass'd with Mountains,
which form so pleasant a Vale, that <i>Charlemain</i>
chose rather to reside at <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>, than in
either of the many beautiful Cities which he conquer'd.
This Emperor caus'd a Collegiate
Church to be built here, in which his Tomb is
still to be seen; and the Memory of that Prince
is to this day held in great Veneration. On
the Festival of St. <i>Charles</i>, there's a solemn Procession
here, in which the Effigies of that Monarch
is carried with an Equipage which excites
Laughter rather than Devotion. The Preacher's
Pulpit in this same Collegiate Church is inrich'd
with Plates of Gold; and they say that the
Branch which hangs down before the High Altar
is of the same Metal. 'Tis in this Church
that many Emperors have been consecrated;
and several of the Imperial Ornaments are still
kept there. The Emperor is born Canon of the
Church of <i>Aix</i>, and takes the Oath as such on
the Day of his Coronation.</p>

<p>Certain Reliques are preserv'd at <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>,
which are shew'd but once in seven years; and<!--240.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
then they are expos'd to View from the top of a
Tower in the City, during which the People
gaze at them on their Knees, in the Squares and
Streets leading to the said Tower. This Ceremony
was perform'd when I was at <i>Aix</i> in 1713,
at which time there was a Concourse to it of
an incredible number of Pilgrims from <i>Hungary</i>,
<i>Tirol</i>, and all the Provinces of <i>Germany</i>. Persons
of superior Rank are allow'd the Liberty of
going up to the top of the Tower where those
Reliques are expos'd, and may look near to them,
but must by no means touch them. Of all that
I saw, I only remember a Smock, which they
affirm was the Virgin's: There were some spots
on it, which they said were the Stains of the Milk
with which she suckled the Savior of the World.
This Shift seem'd to be quite seamless, and made
of a sort of Stuff which I know not how to
describe to you, for it was neither of Linnen
nor Callico.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Aix</i> is very famous for its hot
Baths, and for the Waters that are taken there
twice a year, <i>viz.</i> in <i>Spring</i> and <i>Autumn</i>; at
which two Seasons there's a great Resort hither
of Foreigners. The Waters are hot, and of a
very unpleasant Taste, and they smell like a
rotten Egg; for which reason People are loth
to take them when they first come; but after
they are us'd to it, they go down very well. The
Baths especially are wonderfully good against the
Contraction of the Sinews and against Wounds.
Nor is there a Place where the Waters are us'd
with more Conveniency, there being plenty of
every thing that one wou'd wish for, and especially
good Company; for <i>Brabant</i>, <i>Liege</i>,
<i>France</i>, <i>Holland</i> and <i>Germany</i>, lie so near to it,<!--241.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
that there's always a great many People here,
and very good Diversion.</p>

<p>I set out from <i>Aix</i> for <span class="smcap">Paris</span>, by the way
of <i>Maestricht</i> and <i>Louvain</i>; but as I travell'd
Post thro' these Towns, I shall reserve the Description
of them to you, till such time as I make
a longer stay in them. On my Arrival at <i>Paris</i>
I was deeper in Love than ever. I was receiv'd
by my dear Mistress with such Tokens of Love,
as gave me all the reason in the world to think,
that I was the happiest Man living: And in
reality I was so, because at that time I knew of
no other Happiness than to be in her good Graces;
yet my natural Levity made me soon think
otherwise. I saw the Marchioness <i>de P&mdash;&mdash;</i>;
and I will frankly own to you, that all the Veneration
I had for <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> abated. I thought
then there was nothing to compare with the
new Object of my Passion. <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> quickly perceiv'd
my Inconstancy, and reproach'd me for
it; but they were Reproaches unmix'd with
Gall, and such as nothing but Love can inspire.
The consequence was, that my Passion for her
reviv'd; and upon this occasion I was made sensible,
that a Flame not well extinguish'd is always
apt to burst out again; and that there
needs no great Compulsion to renew the Passion
of Love. The Sentiments of the Man of Honor
being join'd to those of the Lover, I ask'd
my own Conscience what <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> had ever done
to disgust me. And in fine, I gave Judgment
against my self, that I could not without Ingratitude
forsake so amiable a Mistress. I took
care, therefore, to absent my self by degrees
from the Marchioness <i>de P&mdash;&mdash;</i>; and found it
no very hard matter to stifle a Passion, which,
to speak plainly, was but a sudden Flash.<!--242.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>While I staid at the Court of <i>France</i>, I saw
the Ceremony of the double Marriage of the
Duke of <i>Bourbon</i> and the Prince of <i>Conti</i>, who
married each other's Sister. The Duke married
<i>Mary-Anne</i> of <i>Bourbon-Conti</i>, Sister to the Prince
of <i>Conti</i>, who married <i>Louisa-Elizabeth</i> of <i>Bourbon-Condé</i>,
the Duke's Sister.</p>

<p>These Marriages made no addition to the
Pleasures of the Court, and every thing remained
very quiet, till News came of the Advantages
which the Marshal <i>de Villars</i> had gain'd over
the Allies. This Campaign was both glorious
and advantageous to the Marshal; and every body
talk'd of the immense Sums of Money which he had
put into his Pocket. His Conduct was narrowly
pry'd into, and his Enemies charg'd that to
him as a Crime, for which, perhaps, they would
have commended any other General. They said
that he brought with him several Waggons laden
with Bandoliers for Safeguards; and that he got
so much Money by this means, that at his Return
he laid out 1,800,000 Livres in a Purchase.
Nay, they had the Assurance to speak of it to
the King, who said to the Marshal one day at
Dinner, <i>That he heard he had bought a fine
Estate. 'Tis true, Sir</i>, reply'd the Marshal, <i>I
have just purchas'd a very pretty Estate</i>; <i>and if
I have the Honor to command your Army next
year, I hope to buy a more considerable one and
make your Enemies pay for it</i>. This Answer quite
broke the Measures of those who had endeavour'd
to do the Marshal ill Offices. He knew
very well that he had Enemies, but it gave
him little Concern; for he was in high Favor,
and he deserv'd it. They say that when he
set out to make the Campaign in 1713, he said
to the King at taking leave of him, <i>I desire</i><!--243.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
<i>your Majesty to remember, that while I am going
to fight your Enemies, I leave your Majesty in
the midst of mine.</i> He acquitted himself very
bravely; and at length, by the Reduction of
<i>Landau</i> and <i>Fribourg</i>, he procur'd that Peace,
by which the Electors of <i>Cologne</i> and <i>Bavaria</i>
were restor'd to their Dominions.</p>

<p>After I had been some Months at <i>Paris</i> I receiv'd
Letters from <i>Berlin</i>, with Advice, that
the King had Thoughts of forming his Houshold;
and that I could not do better than to
go and offer him my Service. I was not long
in demurring upon what Course to take. I
had always been bred up in Sentiments which
convinc'd me, that to serve one's Sovereign
was preferable to any other Service; and besides,
I always found my self naturally attach'd
to the Family of our Kings. I therefore
resolv'd to leave <i>Paris</i> once more. You
know my Humor so well, <i>Madame</i>, that you
cannot think but it was with some Reluctance
that I form'd a Resolution of this nature;
and I will frankly own to you, that I was
heartily grieved to leave a Place where I had
my fill of Pleasures, which I knew I could
not have a Taste of elsewhere: but at length
I gave Attention only to my Duty; and tho'
the Tears which I saw shed for my sake melted
my Heart, yet they were not powerful enough
to make me alter my Design.</p>

<p>From <i>Paris</i> to <i>Wesel</i>, I went the same Road
that I came; and from <i>Wesel</i> I proceeded to
<span class="smcap">Hanover</span>, where I fell sick. My Design was
to be <i>incog.</i> but the ill State of my Health
oblig'd me to have recourse to a Physician; nay,
I thought one while, that all the Remedies in
the World would do me no good; and that<!--244.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
'twas high Time for me to prepare in good earnest
for my last long Journey. My Kinswoman
Mademoiselle <i>de Pollnitz</i> was soon
inform'd of my Arrival; and as soon acquainted
the Electoress of it, who was so gracious
as to send to know how I did; and this
she repeated twice every day as long as I was
ill. This Princess always had a Kindness for
me, which I shall for ever acknowledge. I was
told, that during my Illness, <i>F&mdash;&mdash;</i> thinking to
divert the Company at my Expence, said at
the Elector's Table, <i>That my Distemper was not
mortal; that I had caught it in <span class="f">France</span>; and
that there were Surgeons at <span class="f">Hanover</span> who had
Skill enough to set me to rights.</i> The Electoress
was very angry with him, and said, <i>Sir, your
Banter is absurd; if he had the Distemper that
you say, he would have staid in <span class="f">France</span> for the
Cure, since he is not ignorant, that the People of
this Country go thither for the same Purpose; and
he has too much Sense not to follow their Example</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as I was able to get abroad, I did not
fail to wait on the Electoress with my most
humble Thanks. That Princess gave me a
much better Reception than I durst presume
to have expected. The Kindness which she
show'd to me, induc'd Mademoiselle <i>de Pollnitz</i>
and Madame <i>de K&mdash;&mdash;</i> to think, that I might
easily obtain Admission into her Service if I
would but ask her; and accordingly those Ladies
prevail'd on me to take that Step, tho' I
very much question'd my Success; and I found
by Experience that my Suspicion was but too
well grounded. I made my Application to the
Princess by Letter; in which, perhaps, I acted
indiscreetly, because I thereby gave her Leisure<!--245.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
to take the Opinion of other People. Accordingly
she did so; and to my misfortune applied
to Madame <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i> who could not endure me;
because, as I heard afterwards, <i>Madame</i> of
<i>France</i> had acquainted the Electoress, that I told
her the Electoral Prince had a particular Respect
for her Ladyship. This was enough to
exasperate a Person against me, who made outward
Profession of the most rigid Virtue; and
when the Electoress consulted her about me, she
was transported to think what an infallible Opportunity
she had to be reveng'd. She artfully
insinuated to the Electoress, that she ought not to
admit me into her Service, and did not want
Reasons to back her Insinuations; the Desire
of Revenge being what always supplies specious
Arguments in abundance to hurt an Enemy.
The Electoress so well approv'd of those she
made use of to exclude me from her Service,
that she order'd M. <i>de P&mdash;&mdash;</i> to tell me, <i>That
she was very much oblig'd to me for the Attachment
which I manifested for her Person; but that she
could not imagine, that after I had serv'd a King,
I should like to wait upon so old a Princess as
she was: That 'twould be more suitable for me to
be in the Service of her Son; and that she should
take a Pleasure to help me to it: But that as for
her self she must stay till she was Queen of <span class="f">England</span>
before she could admit me into her Service; because,
if that should happen, she should then be in a better
Capacity to make my Fortune</i>. You perceive,
<i>Madame</i>, this was a Refusal that I could not well
complain of, 'twas so season'd with everything to
take off the Bitterness of it. For my part, I
own to you that I felt none. As I had only taken
this Step in pure Complaisance to Mademoiselle
<i>de Pollnitz</i>, she was stung to the quick at this<!--246.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Denial; not so much for my sake (I knew very
well what the matter was) but for her own;
whose Vanity was very much mortify'd by it;
for she thought her self in Favor, and saw 'twas
a Favor without any Credit: And her Resentment
proceeded so far, that she hinder'd me
from taking Leave of the Electoress, who in a
few days after set out for <i>Gohr</i> with the Prince
her Son. For my part I also set out from <i>Hanover</i>
for <span class="smcap">Berlin</span>.</p>

<p>When I came thither I found the King's
Houshold Officers already nominated, yet this
did not hinder me from asking his Majesty for
Employment. The Person who spoke for me
was M. <i>de Printz</i> the Grand Marshal, who
brought me News of a Refusal of a very different
sort from what I found at <i>Hanover</i>. In the latter,
I had no reason to complain of the Electoress,
who with all the Politeness possible refus'd
me a Favor, which when all is said and done, I
should not have valued, if I had not ask'd for it.
But now I had a very cruel Repulse, by being
deny'd the only thing for which I had undertaken
the Journey to <i>Berlin</i>. The Behaviour of
the Court to me in this Instance concern'd me
not a little. I had never done any thing to seclude
me from an Establishment in my own
Country. My Ancestors had serv'd in it, and
bore such a distinguish'd Rank in it too, that I
might very well think some Notice would have
been taken of me. Moreover, I had the Honour
of being Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the
late King, but now had the Mortification of seeing
Persons prefer'd before me who had never
been seen at Court, and such too for most part
as are of very obscure Birth. Finding therefore
I had no hopes of succeeding at Court, I saw that<!--247.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
I must go seek my Fortune elsewhere, and I
thought of entring into the Service of the King
of <i>Poland</i>. There was not a fitter Man upon
earth to serve me with that Prince than his
Prime Minister the Count <i>de Flemming</i>, who
happen'd to be then at <i>Berlin</i> upon his Master's
Affairs. I got my Friends to speak to the Count,
and attended him constantly. That Minister
seem'd inclinable to serve me, and promis'd to
speak for me to the King his Master.</p>

<p>He set out for <span class="smcap">Warsaw</span> the latter end of <i>November</i>,
and thither I follow'd him; upon which
he introduc'd me to the King, and to all the
Court-Nobility. I cou'd not have set out better
than I did at the Court of <i>Poland</i>. I was
patronis'd by the Man who mov'd in the highest
Sphere there, next to the King himself; and
for that Reason every body strove to shew me
Respect. The Count <i>de Flemming</i> seem'd to be
pleas'd at the Regard that was paid to me;
at least, I was so short-sighted as not to perceive
that it was to him a matter of very great
Indifference. I was excusable in not suspecting
him of double dealing with me; for hitherto I
had no other Reason but to applaud his Generosity,
and that Good-will which he had express'd
to do me Service. Endeavors were not
wanting to undeceive me, and I soon after saw
with my own Eyes, that the fair Promises he
made to me were nothing more nor less, than
what they call <i>Court-Holy-Water</i>.</p>

<p>Not long after my Arrival at <i>Warsaw</i>, the
King of <i>Poland</i> set out for <i>Germany</i>. I thought
my self bound in Interest to wait for his Return,
in order to treat about my Affairs; and I spent
this time at <i>Warsaw</i> in the most agreeable manner
that could be. I was soon known by all<!--248.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the <i>Polish</i> Nobility, who were as civil to me as
could be imagin'd. Every thing I beheld made
me fancy I was at <i>Paris</i>, there being every
where the same Politeness, and a certain easy
Deportment which the <i>French</i> think none are
Masters of but themselves. The <i>Polish</i> Ladies
are very amiable, witty, and have a good deal
of Sprightliness. With these Qualities, one
would naturally imagine they are not indifferent
to Pleasures; and I observ'd that they have a
delicate and very exquisite Taste for every
thing that passes under the Name of Diversions.
They are passionately fond of Music, and still
more of Plays. And at <i>Warsaw</i> they have as
much of both as they desire; for the King, who
is a Prince as gallant as he is magnificent, takes
care that every thing be done at Court, in a
manner worthy of a great Prince. He maintains
a Set of <i>French</i> Comedians there; and moreover,
frequently gives Balls and Concerts. These Diversions
are generally attended with noble Feasts
that the King makes for the Ladies of his
Court; at which times, that Prince is always
admir'd for his good Mien, and for that Gracefulness
which sets off all his Actions.</p>

<p>The <i>Polish</i> Lords are not near so gay as the
Ladies; or, at least, they don't come up to
them for Elegance and Contrivance. Their
Domestics and Equipage are generally slovenly;
their Tables are indeed serv'd with Profusion,
but without Delicacy, which I take to be intirely
owing to the want of good Officers or
skilful Cooks; for in other respects, <i>Poland</i> is a
Country, where there is as good Cheer as any in
the World. Their Butcher's Meat is delicious,
and they have plenty of good Fish. Wine is
not the Produce of the Country, but the want<!--249.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of it is not perceiv'd at the Tables of the <i>Polish</i>
Nobility, where the Wine of <i>Hungary</i>, tho' very
dear, is drank as common as Water. I observed
one thing at the Generality of their Tables,
that does not tally with the Grandeur which
they pretend to, <i>viz.</i> That the Master of the
House and his intimate Friends drink the best
Wine, while the other Guests that are invited,
are oblig'd to put up with the common sort.
Tis to be observ'd, that tho' <i>Poland</i> abounds
with all Necessaries for Life, yet 'tis a Country
very inconvenient for Travellers, especially
those who are not in a Capacity to carry every
thing along with them. I have not seen a Place
where there is so little Accommodation at the
Public-Houses, there being hardly a Chair in
them to sit down upon. Therefore the Travellers
of any Fashion take care to carry all Necessaries
with them. The Duke of <i>York</i>, Bishop
of <i>Osnabruck</i>, said a very pertinent thing upon
this occasion, <i>viz.</i> <i>That he did not know a Country
where Travellers were more at home than in <span class="f">Poland</span>,
because they were always making use of their
own Furniture</i>.</p>

<p>I heard that the King was shortly to go for
<i>Dresden</i>, and therefore I set out thither immediately
with the Count <i>de Hoim</i>, a Minister of State
to his <i>Polish</i> Majesty. In my Way to <i>Dresden</i>
I saw no Place of Note but <i>Breslau</i> and <i>Leipsic</i>.
<span class="smcap">Breslau</span>, the Capital of <i>Silesia</i>, is a pretty large
and very beautiful City, which in the Winter-Season
is inhabited by a great Number of Nobility.
The Count <i>de Flemming</i> stopping there
a couple of days, I halted there too. I saw very
good Company here, especially at the Houses
of the Count <i>de Maltzam</i>, and the Princess of
<i>Teschen</i>, who was formerly the Princess <i>Lubomirski</i>.<!--250.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
This Lady made a grand Figure, gave
People a hearty Reception, and treated with
Magnificence. I could have wish'd to have staid
at <i>Breslau</i> a few days longer; but as the Count
<i>de Flemming</i>, by whose Patronage I hop'd still
to get some Establishment at Court, was going
to the King in <i>Saxony</i>, I went with him to the
Fair at <i>Leipsic</i>, where the King and Queen were
already arriv'd. As the King had been absent
a good while, the Princes of the Blood, and a
great number of Persons of Quality, came hither
to pay their Respects to him; and after the
Fair was ended, his Majesty return'd to <i>Dresden</i>,
where he had not been long arriv'd, but
he married the Count <i>de Saxony</i> (his natural Son
by the Countess of <i>Koningsmarck</i>) to Mademoiselle
<i>de Loven</i>, who was a young Gentlewoman
of a good Family, and one of the richest in <i>Silesia</i>.
The Ceremony of this Marriage was perform'd
in presence of the whole Court; and
for several days the King gave Feasts answerable
to his good Fancy and Magnificence. His Majesty
is very fond of this Count of <i>Saxony</i>, who
is one of the most amiable Gentlemen that I
have seen; and besides, he very much resembles
the King of <i>Poland</i>, which, to be sure, makes
that Monarch the more in love with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dresden</span><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> was then the Centre of the Pleasures
of <i>Germany</i>, and the Plays, <i>&amp;c.</i> exhibited
here, made me almost think I was at <i>Paris</i>. I
will not trouble you with all the Particulars of
the several splendid Entertainments that were
made in the Carnival Time, there having been
enough written on that Subject already by other
Pens. I shall have the Honor, therefore, to say<!--251.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
nothing more of it to you, than that every Spectator
was more charm'd with the King's affable
Behavior, than they were with the Beauty of the
Representations, and the Splendor of the Feasts.</p>

<p>I should, no doubt, have had a better Relish
for all these Pleasures, if I could have lik'd the
Situation of my Affairs. I had all along conceiv'd
Hopes of entring into the Service of <i>Poland</i>,
and plac'd a very great Dependance on the Promises
made by the Count <i>de Flemming</i>; but when
I came to <i>Dresden</i>, I found the Face of Affairs
quite chang'd. I put him in remembrance of
his Promise; but he answer'd me in such a
droll manner, as convinc'd me that I ought not
to expect any great Matter from him. However,
that I might have nothing to reproach
my self with, I still continu'd to give him Marks
of a very great Attachment to his Person. Yet
I met with several Rebuffs, which did not discourage
me; and which I had the more Reason
to bear with Patience, because I knew that he
treated his most trusty Confidents in the
same manner. At last, not caring, perhaps, to
do any thing of himself, he sent me to M. <i>de
Lowendahl</i> the Grand Marshal, and the latter referr'd
me to M. <i>de Fitzthum</i> the King's Favorite.
I was charm'd with this Gentleman's Politeness
and good Manners; and I don't think
there ever was a Favorite more obliging, and
that took less upon him. Far from amusing me,
he convinc'd me of the Impossibility there was
of my obtaining any Place at Court, unless the
King thro' his special Grace should be inclin'd to
prefer me; which could not be done neither,
without disobliging several of the <i>Polish</i> Noblemen,
who likewise sollicited Places at Court, and
seem'd to have a sort of Right to them by virtue<!--252.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
of their Birth. I did not yet quite despair of
Success; and as this was a Favor that could only
be granted by means of the Count <i>de Flemming</i>,
I had recourse again to that Minister; but I was
never the nearer. To be sure I took a wrong
time to speak to him about my Business, when
perhaps he had other Affairs of greater Consequence
that might ingross his Thoughts. In a
word, he rebuff'd me to such a degree, as was
sufficient to make me quite renounce my Pretensions.
I took leave of the King and Queen, and
prepar'd to go for <i>Berlin</i>.</p>

<p>But before I set out, an Adventure happen'd,
which, together with my Vexation that I had
not succeeded in my Designs, made me hate to
stay any longer at <i>Dresden</i>, as much as I was in
love with the Place when first I came to it. At
<i>Leipsic</i> Fair I had drawn a Bill of 300 Crowns,
payable to the Bearer. The Person for whom I
drew the Bill had given a Commission to a Merchant
at <i>Dresden</i> to receive that Sum. The
Bill did not come to the Merchant's Hands,
till the very Day of my Departure; and as the
Term was expir'd, he sent to my Quarters for
the Money. I was not at home that Minute;
and the Man hearing that I was to set out the
same Day, made use of a Custom introduc'd and
constantly observ'd in <i>Saxony</i>; which is, to arrest
the Person that fails to answer a Bill of Exchange
upon the Day appointed; so that just as
I was going into my Chaise I was made a Prisoner.
It happen'd to be about ten o'clock at
Night. By Misfortune I had lost a great deal
at Play this Carnival; and not having so much
Money by me, I had recourse to the Count <i>de
Flemming</i>; who lent it to me. This was the
only time that I can be sure that Nobleman did<!--253.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
me any Service. I repaid him soon after my
Arrival at <i>Berlin</i>.</p>

<p>Without making a long stay at <i>Berlin</i>, I went
and pass'd a few days at an Estate which I have,
two Leagues out of that City; but the Uneasiness
that haunted me every where, made me resolve
to return to <i>France</i>, having still in View the getting
some Establishment at <i>Berlin</i> or elsewhere.
While I was preparing every thing for my Journey,
I had the Misfortune to break my Left
Leg by a Fall from my Horse. This Accident,
after the various Disgraces and Disappointments
I had already suffer'd, Does it not, <i>Madame</i>,
give you the Idea of another <i>Orestes</i>, pursu'd by
Destiny from one Country to another? I could
expect nothing more after this, than to fall into
the Hands of some Quack of a Bone-setter, who,
after putting me to Torture, would, perhaps,
leave me a Cripple for all the rest of my Life.
To tell you the plain Truth, I had some Apprehension
of it; for a Man of my Kidney could
not but be afraid of every thing in such a Case.
However, whether it was owing to Hap-hazard,
or to the Skill of the Surgeon, after suffering very
great Torment, I was perfectly cur'd; and in
such a manner, that I never felt any thing of it
afterward. The ninth Day after my Fall I went
to <i>Berlin</i>. As my Indisposition was such, that
I could travel neither in a Chaise nor Coach, I
hir'd Porters to carry me; so that my Entry
was more than ordinary comic. This new Equipage
surpriz'd all that saw it, the Children especially,
who not being us'd to see such Carriages,
follow'd me from the Out-parts of the
City to my Lodgings; and as the Numbers
swell'd by the Way, the Train consisted of at
least 200 Followers, by that time I came home.<!--254.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
I was very sensible, at my Arrival, that I had
done wrong to be carried abroad so soon; for a
Fever took me, and not long after an Imposthume
gather'd, that bred the Distemper which
they call in <i>France</i> the <i>King's Evil</i>. A fresh
Reason this for my Complaint of the Severity of
my Destiny; for in reality I suffer'd such Pains
for above twenty Days, as are impossible for me
to express.</p>

<p>As soon as I was in a Condition to go abroad,
I waited on the Queen, who had just receiv'd
Tydings, that the Elector of <i>Hanover</i>, her Father,
was then call'd over by the <i>English</i> to
succeed the deceas'd Queen <i>Anne</i>. No doubt,
<i>Madame</i>, you remember the Joy there was at
Court upon this News. The King made an
Offer to the new Monarch of any Assistance
that he might have occasion for, to support him
on the Throne. Some days after the Arrival
of this great News, I took leave of the Queen,
and set out for <span class="smcap">Hambourg</span>.</p>

<p>I was very well receiv'd in this City by <i>L&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
who was at that time Envoy from <i>Prussia</i> to
the Circle of Lower <i>Saxony</i>. I knew him at a
time when Fortune, as it were, frown'd upon
him; but now it might be said, that she had
loaded him with her Favors. He was glad to
see me, and that he had an Opportunity of
shewing me in what Grandure he liv'd. Since
he had married a Woman, who was, indeed,
very old, but very rich, he had been so wise as
to make an Acquaintance with such as were capable
of serving him; and whether 'twas owing
to Money, or to mere Favor, he was quickly
made a Minister of State; and in a little time
after receiv'd the Key as one of the King's Chamberlains.
I was very well pleas'd to see him in<!--255.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
so splendid a Situation; but could not help taking
pity on him for being yok'd to a Wife so
disagreeable. She was a Person, who with the
Obstinacy and Ill-nature of Old Age, had all the
Mettle of Youth, besides her being a perfect
Original both in her Apparel, and in the Furniture
of her House. Her Husband could never
prevail upon her to dress as became a Person
of her Rank, nor to alter any thing in her
Furniture, tho' ever so unpolite. I had the
Pleasure one day that I was invited thither to
Supper, of examining the Inside of the House
at my Leisure. The Apartment where we supp'd
was furnish'd in a very whimsical Manner. The
first Room was lin'd with black Leather gilt,
and round it were plac'd Chairs of green Taffety,
adorn'd with Furbelows of a Rose Color. The
second Chamber was hung with green Tapestry.
The Chairs were of black Velvet, lac'd with
Gold, and the Room was full of Crystal Sconces.
At one End of it there was an Alcove
hung with white Leather gilded, and in the
Middle of the Alcove there was a Bed of a very
extraordinary Fashion, which had no Curtains,
but had four Pillars to support the Tester, and
a Wooden Cornish at the top gilded; and the
Whole was cover'd with Mother of Pearl and
Tortoise-shell. The Bed had a Counterpane on
it of black Velvet and Gold-Lace. In the four
Corners of the Alcove were four Statues of white
Marble, each holding a Wax-Candle. There
were other Wax-Candles upon gilded Sconces,
and a very fine Branch. The Whole, I assure
you, look'd much more like a Room for lying
in State, than a Chamber for Entertainment.
We sat down, however, to Table; but this
amiable Lady refus'd to be of the Company, and<!--256.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
chose to stay behind a Door, which was in the
Alcove, from whence she resolv'd to be a Spectatress
of the Entertainment through the Chinks.</p>

<p>We were all heartily at Supper, and in very little
pain for the Absence of our Landlady, when on a
sudden there came from the Alcove a very ugly Figure,
dress'd all in white. I was the first that perceiv'd
it; and really, if I had given ever so little
Credit to the haunting of Houses by Spirits, I
should have thought I then saw one. The
Whole perfectly resembled that Scene of the
Knight in the <i>Festin de Pierre</i>, excepting nevertheless
that we were not honor'd with the
least Obeisance. I heard swearing and scolding
at the Domestics, which made me suspect that
it might be the Mistress of the House. Nor was
I mistaken, we were obliged for this Apparition
to a Wax-Candle that drop'd upon a Velvet
Chair, which she perceiv'd from the Place
where she was conceal'd, and stay'd some time,
thinking that one or other of the Domestics
would have remedied this Evil; but at last seeing
that no body minded it, she resolv'd to come
out her self to the Relief of the Chair. This
Apparition was the Cause of a great Hurly-burly;
the Lackeys excus'd themselves, because they
were employ'd in waiting; and there were
long and warm Disputes on both sides, betwixt
the Mistress and the Servants, during which,
the Guests, who rose in Respect to the Lady,
were all the while standing. The Husband endeavor'd
to pacify his dear Spouse, and made
her sensible of the Situation in which she kept
us; upon which, without making the least Compliment,
she sate down at the Table, and I thought
the Rage of the Storm was over; but far from
it, she was no sooner seated than she began again
to rave with more Fury than before. A<!--257.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Lackey, to whom, it seems, all this Bawling was
more distasteful than it was to us, thought fit
to tell her very bluntly, <i>That she made a great
Noise for nothing</i>. Then the Lady was quite
outragious, and went to give the Lackey a Blow
with all the Weight of her Arm; but the Droll
cunningly parry'd it, by receiving the Stroke
upon a Plate he had in his Hand; which, as he
manag'd it, serv'd him for a Shield. The Gentlewoman
gave herself such a terrible Blow, that
for one while she could not speak; and when
she came to her self, she made a worse Racket
than before. At length, the Lackey was turn'd
out of the Room; and at that very instant,
luckily for us, the Pain which the Lady felt for
the Blow, increas'd to such a degree, that she
was forc'd to retire. She was no sooner gone
but we all burst out in a Laugh. The Husband
himself was ready to split his Sides, and desir'd
the Company to be under no manner of Restraint,
but to talk as gayly of this Adventure
as we pleas'd. Indeed we were heartily merry
at the Expence of the Old Lady; but yet we
were the greatest Losers by it in the end; for
while we thought her a good way out of Hearing,
she thought fit to stay at the Door to listen
to what we said, which not being to her liking,
she took an immediate Revenge, for she deprived
us of the Dessert, and the poor Husband had
not Interest enough to get another.</p>

<p>I was so gorg'd at this charming Repast, that
for fear of a second Invitation I set out next Day
for <span class="smcap">Hanover</span>, where I arriv'd the very Day
before the new King set out for <i>England</i>. The
Electoress, his Mother, to whom the Crown
first belong'd of Right, died suddenly, as she
was walking in <i>Herrenhausen</i> Garden, not long<!--258.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
before Queen <i>Anne</i> died. The Elector her Son
was recogniz'd King by the <i>English</i>, as the next
Protestant Heir; for if the Catholics could have
had any Right to the Crown, this Elector would
have been but the 23d or 24th in the direct
Line. The Nobleman who acquainted the Elector
of his Advancement to the Crown was
my Lord <i>Clarendon</i>, Envoy from the Queen of
<i>England</i> at the Court of <i>Hanover</i>. Perhaps it
was with some Regret that he executed this Commission,
being related to the <i>Stuart</i> Family;
and as it was generally thought, not very
much inclin'd to the Family which now governs
<i>England</i>. Be this as it will, he discharg'd the
Commission with a good Grace. My Lord receiv'd
the News that the <i>English</i> had proclaim'd
the Elector for their King, one Evening as he
had been at Supper with that Prince at a House
called <i>The Whim</i>, belonging to Madame <i>de K&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
now my Lady <i>L&mdash;&mdash;</i>. As his Lordship came
home he found a Courier just arriv'd with the
Privy Council's Orders to him, to recognize the
Elector for King of <i>England</i>. He immediately
got into his Coach, and went to <i>Herrenhausen</i>,
where he found the Elector a-bed. His Lordship
thinking 'twas worth while to awake the
Elector, for the sake of telling him the News
that so great a Diadem was fallen to him, enter'd
his Bed-Chamber, and kneeling on the
Floor, was the first that recogniz'd the Elector
for King. This Prince immediately summon'd
his Council. Many People were pleas'd to say,
that the Elector hesitated for a good while, whether
or no he should accept of the August Dignity
that was offer'd to him; but for my part, I
fancy, that the Voyage to <i>England</i> was more
the Subject of the Council's Deliberation, than<!--259.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the Question, whether its Crown should be accepted.</p>

<p>After the Council was over, the new King
was complimented upon his Accession to the
Throne; and that very Instant he gave Orders
to get every thing ready for his Departure,
which was fix'd for the 11th of <i>September</i>. The
Time between the Elector's assuming the Royal
Stile and his Departure, was spent in sending
and receiving Couriers to and from the principal
Courts of <i>Europe</i>. All the Nobility and
Gentry, Subjects to the new Monarch, flock'd
from all Parts to see him before he went away.
This Prince was so well belov'd, that his Subjects
were very sorry that he was going to leave them;
but for his part, tho' his People were not a little
dear to him, he preserv'd that Tranquillity of
Mind, and that Discretion, which govern'd all
his Actions; and he seem'd no more concerned
at parting with them, than he was elated with
his new Dignity: but it was otherwise with the
Prince his Son, who was so impress'd with the
Fortune added to his Family, that I heard him
say to an <i>English</i> Gentleman, the Day before he
went, <i>That he had not one Drop of Blood in his
Veins but what was <span class="f">English</span>, and at the Service
of his new Subjects</i>.</p>

<p>On the 11th of <i>September</i>, early in the Morning,
the King and the Prince of <i>Wales</i> set out
from <i>Herrenhausen</i>, amidst the Acclamations of
the Court and the People, with which the Road
was lin'd. They wish'd his Majesty all manner
of Happiness, and accompanied him with their
good wishes a good distance from <i>Herrenhausen</i>,
before they took Leave of his Majesty.
The last Farewels were attended with so many
Tears, that the King could not help being a<!--260.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
little mov'd; and he assur'd them, <i>That it
should not be long before he would make a Tour to</i>
Hanover.</p>

<p>The King's Retinue was not very numerous;
for he only took with him such Persons as were
absolutely necessary for his Service; and of these
too, he sent some back, when he went on board
the Yatcht that came for him to <i>Holland</i>, to
carry him over to <i>England</i>. The Princess of <i>Wales</i>
follow'd the King some time after, with the
Princesses her Daughters; but Prince <i>Frederic</i>
her Son remain'd at <i>Hanover</i> for his Education.</p>

<p>When the King came to <i>London</i>, he found Subjects
as much attach'd to his Person, as those he had
left at <i>Hanover</i>; and not long after his Arrival
he was, according to Custom, crown'd at <i>Westminster</i>.
There was so great a Concourse of People
at the Ceremony, that it seem'd as if all
the Nation had flock'd thither to receive their
new Sovereign. I was told there was only
one Person, and that was a Woman, who refus'd
to own him for King; and that this happen'd
upon the very Day of the Coronation,
when a Champion, arm'd from Head to Foot,
entring into the Banquetting-Hall, and according
to Custom challenging any Person whatsoever,
who did not acknowledge the Elector of
<i>Hanover</i> as lawful King of <i>England</i>, that Lady
threw down her Glove, and with a very ill-tim'd
Effrontery made Answer aloud, <i>That
<span class="f">James</span> the Third was the only lawful Heir of the
Crown, and that the Elector of <span class="f">Hanover</span>was an
Usurper</i>.</p>

<p>Not many days after the King of <i>England</i>'s
Departure, I set out from <i>Hanover</i> for <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>,
where I made use of the Baths, as my<!--261.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Physicians had order'd me, to strengthen my
Leg. From <i>Aix</i> I proceeded in the <i>Paris</i> Road
to <span class="smcap">Mastricht</span><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, which is a strong Place belonging
to <i>Dutch Brabant</i>, tho' situate in the
middle of the Country of <i>Liege</i>, on which it was
for a long time dependent. It was also subject to
the <i>Spaniards</i> till 1633, when it was taken by
the <i>Dutch</i>, who were acknowledg'd lawful Possessors
thereof by the Peace of <i>Munster</i>, and
were thereupon at great Expence to fortify it, so
that it was reckon'd one of the strongest Places in
<i>Europe</i>, when <i>Lewis</i> XIV. took it in 1673, in
13 Days time. The King himself then commanded
his Army; and he had with him <span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>
his Brother. Three Years after this, the
Allies besieg'd it also, but their Arms being not
so successful as those of <i>France</i>, they were forc'd
to abandon their Enterprize. At last, by the
Peace of <i>Nimeguen</i> it was restor'd to the <i>Dutch</i>,
who keep a strong Garrison in it.</p>

<p><i>Mastricht</i> is very well built, in a flat Country,
surrounded with Hills. The <i>Maese</i> runs thro'
the City, over which there is a very high Stone
Bridge. They say that the late Count <i>d'Auverquerque</i>,
who died Velt-Marshal of the <i>Dutch</i>,
out of pure Gallantry, to convince a Lady how
much he lov'd her, leap'd his Horse off the
Bridge into the <i>Maese</i>. This young Lady so
much belov'd was Mademoiselle <i>de Feltbruck</i>.
As she was passing over the Bridge, Count
<i>d'Auverquerque</i>, who rode by the side of her
Coach, entertain'd her very much about his<!--262.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Passion for her; but Miss so little heeded what
he said, that she scarce vouchsaf'd to lend him
an Ear. At length being fatigu'd with hearing
the same String always harp'd upon, she told
him, that Lovers were never sparing of their
Promises; but when any Testimonials were demanded
of their Love, they then discover'd
how little it was to be depended on. <i>For instance,
Sir</i>, said she, <i>I would venture a good
Wager now, that if I were to ask you to leap
from this Bridge into the River, you would not do
it</i>. The furious Lover made no other Answer
to this Defiance, but clapping Spurs to his Horse,
leap'd him off of the Bridge into the <i>Maese</i>. The
young Lady thought her generous Lover would
most certainly be drown'd; but luckily for him
he kept his Seat, and his Horse, which was as
mettlesome as the best, had Strength enough
after such a Leap, to swim with his Rider to an
Island, whither a Boat was sent to fetch him.
After such a Trial as this, the young Lady
might boast, either that she was lov'd to Distraction,
or that she had a distracted Lover.</p>

<p>From <i>Mastricht</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Louvain</span><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, which
is surnamed the <i>Wise</i>, probably by reason of its
University, which was founded in 1426, by
<i>John</i> IV. Duke of <i>Brabant</i>, and has been in its
time one of the most celebrated Universities in
<i>Europe</i>; but it has not that Reputation now.
And as to the City, 'tis much more famous for
its Antiquity, than upon any other account; for
they say it was founded by <i>Julius Cæsar</i>. 'Tis
indeed, at present, a very large City, but ill
built, the only remarkable Edifices that I
saw there, are the Collegiate Church dedicated
to St. <i>Peter</i>, and the Church of the Jesuits.<!--263.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
<i>Louvain</i> is not a Place of great Trade as yet, but
a very fine Causey which is made from thence
to <i>Brussels</i>, and another to <i>Tongres</i>, which is to
be carried on to <i>Liege</i>, will very much increase
its Commerce, especially with the <i>Austrian Netherlands</i>.</p>

<p>I went from <i>Louvain</i> to <i>Brussels</i>, and from
thence to <span class="smcap">Ghent</span><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, which is the Capital of
<i>Spanish Flanders</i>, and one of the biggest Cities
in <i>Europe</i>. It stands four Leagues from the
Sea, is water'd with three Rivers, the <i>Scheld</i>,
the <i>Lys</i>, and the <i>Lise</i>, and adorn'd with fine
Squares and noble Buildings. The great Clock
is worth seeing; it weighs 11000 Pounds, and
is erected upon a Dragon, which Count <i>Baldwin</i>
brought from <i>Constantinople</i>. A Canal has been
dug from this City to the Sea, which is of very
great Service to its Trade.</p>

<p>'Twas at <i>Ghent</i> that <i>Charles</i> V. was born,
who granted this City extraordinary Privileges;
yet the Inhabitants were so ungrateful as to rebel
against this Emperor, who resolv'd to punish
them for it; and that he might go the
nearer way to work with 'em, ventur'd upon
the Parole of <i>Francis</i> I. to pass thro' <i>France</i>, in
order to come at them. He chastis'd those Rebels
with such Severity, that they had no reason
to boast that this Emperor was their Countryman.
He caus'd twenty-five of their principal
Citizens to be executed by the common Hangman,
banish'd a greater number of them, confiscated
their Estates, and took away all their
Privileges. In fine, <i>Ghent</i> which was one of
the most considerable Cities in <i>Europe</i>, soon became
a Desert; and <i>Charles</i> V. to leave a Monument<!--264.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
of his Wrath to Posterity, caus'd a Fortress
to be built, which is still the Citadel of this
Place, and is of great Consequence to the Emperor,
when he happens to be at War with <i>France</i>;
for when the <i>French</i> are Masters of <i>Ghent</i>, the
Navigation of the <i>Scheld</i> is interrupted; and in
case of a War, 'tis better to see them Masters of
<i>Brussels</i> than of <i>Ghent</i>: For I remember, that in
1708, while the Allies besieg'd <i>Lisle</i>, the <i>French</i>
being then Masters of <i>Ghent</i>, incommoded their
Army very much. This City is finely recover'd
since <i>Charles</i> the Vth's Time. The States of <i>Flanders</i>
have their Assemblies here, and the Emperor
commonly signifies his Will and Pleasure
to them, by the Governor-General of the <i>Netherlands</i>
residing at <i>Brussels</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Ghent</i> I went thro' <i>Courtray</i> and <i>Menin</i>
to <span class="smcap">Lisle</span><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, which is the Capital of <i>French Flanders</i>,
and one of the best and most beautiful
Towns of that Government. It belong'd formerly
to the King of <i>Spain</i>, till 1667, when
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. took it in Person. The Garison
then consisting of but 6000 Men, was not strong
enough to check the Progress of the <i>French</i>
Arms, so that after nine Days open Trenches
the Place was taken. <i>Lisle</i> was left in the Possession
of <i>France</i> by the Treaty of <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>,
in 1668; but in 1708, the Allies after a
tedious and toilsome Siege, made themselves
Masters of it. At last, however, this City reverted
to <i>France</i> by the Treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>. The
Inhabitants were so overjoy'd at their not being
left in subjection to the <i>Dutch</i>, which they
were afraid of, that on the Day the Place was
evacuated, they made Bonfires in all parts of<!--265.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the Town; and not without Cause, for after
they fell under the Dominion of the <i>Dutch</i>, their
Trade stood still, those new Guests chusing rather
to send for what they wanted from <i>Holland</i>,
than to make use of the Manufactures of this City.
But with the <i>French</i> the Case was otherwise, for
they bought their Necessaries in the City, and
liv'd with the Inhabitants on perfect good
Terms.</p>

<p><i>Lewis</i> XIV. made <i>Lisle</i> one of the finest Places
in <i>Europe</i>. Its Streets are magnificent, and particularly
the Street <i>Royale</i>, built in the Reign
of that Monarch. 'Tis very strait, and adorn'd
on both sides with very fine Houses built alike.
In this City resides the Governor of <i>Flanders</i>.
The Marshal <i>de Boufflers</i> was succeeded in this
Government by the Duke his Son. When I
was here, the Prince <i>de Tingry</i>, Governor of
<i>Valenciennes</i>, officiated in this Government for
the said Duke, who was then under Age.</p>

<p>I was so impatient to be at <i>Paris</i>, that I
made no stay in any Place upon the Road, till I
arriv'd there. I alighted at a Bagnio, and the
first Sally I made abroad was to pay my Devoirs
to Mademoiselle <i>de S&mdash;&mdash;</i>. Absence had not
damp'd my Flame, and I was only glad to see
<i>Paris</i> again, in hopes of finding out her whom
I ador'd. But how was I surpriz'd when the
Mother of that lovely Damsel came to welcome
me with a Flood of Tears, and told me, that
I must think no more of her Daughter, for
that she died about a Month ago in the Province
of <i>Perigord</i>, whither she went to accompany a
Lady of her Acquaintance! I was so thunder-struck
at this News, that I was not able to
speak. I fainted away, was carried back to my
Lodgings, and was that Moment let blood;<!--266.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
but 'twas some time after it before I came to my
self, and then I did nothing but give my self up
to Sorrow. Mine was no longer an inward
Grief, but vented it self in such continual Exclamations
interrupted with Sighs, that every
one who saw me believ'd I was going the way
of all Flesh; or that, at least, I should be out
of my Senses: And truly they were not much
mistaken, for I was so in a great measure. In
this unhappy Situation did I remain five whole
Days, at the end of which the Mother of <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>
came to make me a Visit; and at her entring
into my Room, she told me, that her Daughter
was not dead; and that she had just receiv'd a
Letter from her, by which she acquainted her,
that she should soon be at <i>Paris</i>. This sort of
Resurrection was as reviving News to me, as
the former was mortifying. I felt a surprizing
Revolution in my Spirits; and am of Opinion,
that if 'tis possible to die with an Excess of Joy
or of Grief, I had share enough of both those
Passions within a short Space of Time not to
survive them. But I was reserv'd by Fate for
other Adventures.</p>

<p>In Fact, I was hardly recover'd from the several
Shocks which I had lately undergone,
but was forc'd to bear the Brunt of another.
The Occasion of this was, meeting at the House
of a Lady of my Acquaintance with a Friend of
<i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>, whose Name was Madame <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>;
and who had been married for some time, by the
Advice of her Parents, to a Man far advanc'd
in Years. The young Lady hated her Husband
more heartily than is common for Girls of sixteen
that marry to Men of above sixty. I had
seen her formerly, but she was then so young,
that I did not much mind her: And happy<!--267.png--><span class="pagenum">261</span>
wou'd it have been for me, if I had always view'd
her with the same Indifference! But when I came
to see her after her Marriage, her Beauty, her fine
Presence and her noble Deportment made a very
sensible Impression on me. I was pitch'd upon
to play at Cards with her and another Lady,
and all the time she did nothing but rally me upon
my Amour with <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>, and hinted several
times to me, that the Lady was not deserving
of the Heart I had set upon her. As I could
not guess to what all this Discourse tended, when
the Game was over I went with the Lady to a
distant Window, and there begged her for God's
sake to explain her self. She stood out a long
while, on pretence that she should be oblig'd to
tell me what would only make me uneasy: But all
these Delays rendering me still the more impatient
to know what it could be, I press'd her to
such a degree that at last she consented to let
me into the Secret. <i>You won't take a Denial, I see</i>,
said she: <i>Well then, if you must know, you shall.
But you must thank your self for it, if I tell you
what will heartily vex you; for I know your Temper,
and to what a Degree you are smitten. You
think</i>, continu'd she, <i>that</i> S&mdash;&mdash; <i>is in the Country,
but you are mistaken; for she is at</i> Paris,
<i>and has never been out of it all the time. She is
as much in love with the Marquis</i> de V&mdash;&mdash;, <i>as
he is with her. She keeps no Company now but
him. Two Months ago she remov'd from her House
in the Suburb of</i> St. Antoine, <i>where she then liv'd,
because she heard you was coming to Town. The
truth is, she did not care you should reproach her
to her Face; and being in Hopes that you might
forget her, she sent to let you know, that she was
dead; but hearing that you was so inconsolably melancholy,
it mov'd her to pity you, and she has now</i><!--268.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
<i>sent you word that she is still living. Indeed it
won't be long before you see her; but it will only
be to receive your Dismission, and to give you to
understand from her own Lips, that she prefers</i>
V&mdash;&mdash;<i>'s Addresses to yours. I have heard all this from
one of my Waiting-Women, whose Sister is a Servant
to Madame</i> S&mdash;&mdash;. <i>For as to my part, since
I am married to M.</i> R&mdash;&mdash;, <i>'tis not convenient for
me to keep her Company. You will do well to
renounce her, and need not fear but you may find
better than her.</i> As she express'd these Words
her Eyes darted in my Face, and at the same
instant she blush'd. I was going to make her
an Answer, but she left me abruptly, and all the
rest of the Evening made it her Business to avoid
me, I thought, however, to have an Opportunity
of speaking to her when she was going
out; but she went away with another Lady, so
that 'twas impossible for me to say a Word to
her.</p>

<p>I return'd home miserably disturb'd in my
Mind. Hatred, Love, Revenge, Contempt;
in short, all the Passions of a Lover, slighted on
the one hand, and flatter'd on the other, play'd
their part to rack my Brain. Guess, <i>Madame</i>,
in what a Condition I was, when I had such violent
Attacks to struggle with. In fine, Contempt
triumph'd over the Passion I had conceiv'd
for <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>. The charming Eyes of Madame <i>de
R&mdash;&mdash;</i> made me forget the false-hearted Creature
on whom I had doated. But in the sequel I was
quickly convinc'd that I was no sooner cur'd of
one foolish Amour, but I was plung'd into another
of the same Nature. The last Words of
<i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> seem'd to be very engaging; I explain'd
them in my own favor, and thought sincerely
that she had taken a Fancy to me. I flatter'd<!--269.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
my self again and again with these agreeable Notions,
and found an infinite Pleasure in making my
own Chain. Nevertheless you will soon see that I
was bubbled as much in this Amour as I was in
the former. Madame <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i> was one of
the finest Women, and without dispute one of
the greatest Coquettes in <i>Paris</i>; being whimsical
withal, and more self-conceited than Women
of that Cast generally are; she did not understand
what it was to settle her Heart upon any
Man, and yet expected to be doated on herself.
I push'd head-long into this new Engagement,
and thought my self at one time the happiest
Man in the World. My Friends too were as
much deceiv'd as I was, and thought me for a
long while the only Favorite. I will tell ye hereafter
what became of this Amour, and shall for
the present break off the Detail of these ridiculous
Amusements, to tell you how it far'd with
me in the Affair which most demanded my Application.</p>

<p>Soon after my Return to <i>Paris</i>, I went to
<i>Versailles</i>, where I had the Honor to pay my
Duty to the King and the Princes. <i>Madame</i>
receiv'd me so kindly that I thought my self
sure of her Protection, and therefore acquainted
her of my Intention to beg an Employment of
his Majesty, and desir'd her that she would be so
good as to recommend me. Madame promis'd me
that she would, and was true to her Word; for
she not only spoke her self but also made the
Duke of <i>Orleans</i> speak for me to M. <i>Voisin</i>, who
was at that time Chancellor and Secretary of
War. This Gentleman promis'd their Royal
Highnesses that he would think of a Place for
me; but when I waited upon him, with one of
Madame's Officers, who, by her Order introduc'd<!--270.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
me, that Minister receiv'd me with a
Countenance as crabbed as ever I saw. His Head
was invelop'd in a monstrous large Peruke, that
hindered both his Sight and Hearing, which at
other times were natural enough to him. However,
in Respect to Madame he heard me, and
then said, that the King had already made one
considerable Reduction in his Troops, and was
going to make another; and that therefore he
did not see what Hopes I could have of being
employ'd. I was very much dissatisfied with
this Answer, which was so different from the
Promise he had made to Madame and the Duke
of <i>Orleans</i>. I made a Report to their Royal
Highnesses of what the Minister said to me;
upon which the Duke of <i>Orleans</i> told me, <i>This
signifies nothing, I will speak to him again, and I
hope you will find your Account in it</i>. He spoke
accordingly, but <i>Voisin</i> did nothing the more nor
the less for it. However, as I had a grateful
Heart for the Advances which Madame and the
Duke her Son had been so good as to make in
my favor, I continu'd to pay my Duty to them;
and they both gave me Demonstration that they
were not Insensible of my constant Attendance.
I was almost every Night at the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>'s
Couchée. His Court was then but small,
and excepting his Domestics I was sometimes
all alone with him. I was the more amaz'd at
the Carriage of the Courtiers to this Prince, because
'twas natural to think that the Government
of the Kingdom would soon fall into his hands.
The Duke of <i>Berry</i> was just dead. The King
was too old to expect he could live much longer,
and the Dauphin too young to take the Management
of Affairs upon him for a good while.
In short, every thing promis'd this Prince the<!--271.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Regency of the Kingdom infallibly, yet scarce
any body regarded him as the rising Sun. The
Courtiers Respect for the King made them all
stick to his Majesty, and a Reign so glorious and
so long, seem'd to them as if it was never to
have End.</p>

<p>I stay'd at <i>Paris</i> the rest of the year 1714,
and some Months of the year 1715. This Winter
there was one of the noblest Sights in <i>Paris</i> that
could be, <i>viz.</i> The Entry of the <i>Persian</i> Ambassador,
and especially the Audience he had of his
Majesty some days after it. But the Ambassador
did not contribute so much to the Lustre of this
Shew, as to give us any great Idea of the <i>Persian</i>
Magnificence; and indeed, in my whole Life I
never saw any thing so pitiful; for all his Equipage
being out of Order, his Domestics having
scarce Cloaths to their Backs, and almost all
of them ill-looking Fellows, formed a very melancholy
Scene. Besides, the Presents he brought
were really not worthy of the Prince that sent
them, or of him that received them. Before
this Ambassador made his Entry, he lodg'd at
<i>Charenton</i>, to which Place every body went to
stare at him as a Prodigy. The Torrent carried
me thither among the rest, and a numerous Company
there was of us. The Interpreter told us,
before we went in, that a Compliment must be
made to the Ambassador, and we drew Cuts to
determine who should be the Speaker. The
Lot fell upon me. I made but a very short
Speech to him, wherein after having congratulated
him upon his Arrival, I told him, that
I hop'd his Stay in <i>Europe</i>, and especially in
<i>France</i>, would not be disagreeable to him. He
thank'd me by his Interpreter, and bid him tell
me, that as he was come to see the greatest King<!--272.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
in the World, next to the Sophy his Master,
he should be always satisfy'd, happen what would
to him, when once he had appeared before his
Majesty. He made us sit down, and we ask'd
him several Questions concerning his Voyage,
the Court of <i>Persia</i>, and the Sophy; but he told
us, that he had never been at <i>Ispahan</i>, and never
seen the Sophy. During this Conversation
he gave us Coffee and Sweet-meats, and was
mighty civil to us.</p>

<p>But upon all Occasions when his Character
was to be supported, he was not near so tractable;
for he then took upon him too much State, so
that when the Marshal <i>de Matignon</i>, who was to
come from the King to carry him to the Ambassadors
House, was to enter his Chamber, he
pretended that he was not obliged to stand up.
The Baron <i>de Breteuil</i>, the Introductor of the Ambassadors,
represented to him that he could do
no less than pay that Deference to M. <i>de Matignon</i>
who came from the King; but he might as
well have reason'd with a Post; and all that he
could get from him, was a Promise, that when
the Marshal entered his Chamber he wou'd that
Moment rise and go out all at once. There
was another Scene to manage when he came
down Stairs. They proposed to him to ride in
the King's Coach; but he said, he would do no
such thing; that it was a Cage; and that he
would make his Entry on horseback. The
Baron <i>de Breteuil</i>, therefore, in order to make
him get into the Coach, was under a Necessity
of talking smartly to him; and even to threaten
him, that he should make no Entry, nor have
any Audience, if he did not subject himself to
the Customs establish'd in <i>France</i>. At length
the Ambassador capitulated, they split the Difference,<!--273.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and he consented to ride one half of the
way in the Coach, and the other on horseback.
I never saw such a Multitude of People
as I did at this Entry; the Concourse was really
astonishing; for from the first Bar in the Suburb
of <i>St. Antoine</i> to the Ambassadors House, there
were Scaffolds all along on both sides of the way,
full of People. The same Croud of Spectators
follow'd him for several days, so that when he
went abroad, either to the Bagnio, or to take
the Air, he could scarce go along, there were
such Throngs of People to gaze at him.</p>

<p>The Audience which the King gave him was
a very magnificent Scene. <i>Lewis</i> XIV. appeared
at it in all the Majesty of a great King; and be
the Audiences of the <i>Great Mogul</i>, describ'd to
us by <i>Tavernier</i>, ever so brilliant, I can scarce
think they are to compare with the Ceremony
I am now speaking of, and whereof I was an
Eye-witness, which was performed in the Great
Gallery at <i>Versailles</i>. The King's Throne, which
was at one end, and rais'd very high, was of a
Gold Ground, with Flowers and the Arms of
<i>France</i> embroider'd on it. The King was dress'd
in a Suit of Coffee-color'd Velvet, adorn'd with
Jewels, to the Value of several Millions. The
young Dauphin was at his Majesty's Right Hand
in a Robe of Gold Brocade, adorn'd with Diamonds
and Pearls. The Duke of <i>Orleans</i> was
on his Left, dress'd in a Suit of blue Velvet, adorn'd
with a Gold <i>Spanish</i> Point, seeded with
very beautiful Diamonds and Pearls. The Princes
of the Blood, the legitimated Princes, the
Prince of <i>Dombes</i> and the Count <i>d'Eu</i>, both Sons
to the Duke of <i>Maine</i>, sat in the same Row, on
the Right and Left of the King, all observing the
Rank due to their Birth. All along the Gallery<!--274.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
on the Right-Side of the Throne, there were
several Rows of Steps, on which stood the Ladies
richly dress'd. The Duchess of <i>Berry</i> and Madame
were next to the Throne, and next to
them stood the Electoral Prince of <i>Saxony</i>, who
was then at the Court of <i>France</i> with the Title
of the Count of <i>Lusatia</i>. That Side of the
Gallery which fronts the Garden was taken up
by Noblemen richly apparell'd, and the Space
which serv'd for the Passage, from the Entrance
of the Gallery to the Throne, was cover'd with
a magnificent Tapestry, as were the rest of the
Apartments from the Stair-Case of Marble to
the Gallery. In the Courts below, the Regiments
of the <i>French</i> and <i>Swiss</i> Guards, newly
cloath'd, were rang'd in Order of Battle: And
the Life-Guards, the Musketeers, and all the
King's Houshold Troops were also drawn up
in the same Order. But the Splendor of the
Soldiery was very much lessen'd by a great
Quantity of Rain which pour'd down almost all
day long.</p>

<p>The Ambassador with all his Attendance
pass'd thro' all those Troops to the Gallery; and
when he was advanc'd near to the Throne, he
there deliver'd his Credentials to M. <i>de Torcy</i>,
Minister and Secretary of State, by whom they
were given to the Interpreter, who read them.
He afterwards gave his Majesty the Presents that
the Sophy sent him, which were so inconsiderable,
that at first sight one could hardly imagine
they were sent from one of the most powerful
Monarchs of <i>Asia</i>. The Whole consisted of
Turquoise Stones, a Scymitar garnish'd with precious
Stones, a Box of Balm to which he ascribed
wonderful Virtues, and some other things
of no great Value. After the Audience was over,<!--275.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the Ambassador was regal'd, and then reconducted
to the House of the Ambassadors,
where he was defray'd at the Expence of the
Court, all the time that he staid at <i>Paris</i>. He
was furnish'd at first with the King's Horses for
himself and his Retinue; but as his Stay was long,
and as besides he spoil'd all the King's Horses,
he was accommodated afterwards with Horses
that were hir'd.</p>

<p>Some time after this Audience, the Ambassador
went to the Opera, where the Benches in
the Amphitheatre were taken away, to make it
more commodious to hold him and his Retinue.
Tho' there was an incredible number of People
of the first Quality, he seem'd to be under no
manner of Constraint, and smoak'd his Pipe
there a good while, with as much Freedom, as
if he had been in his Chamber. The Eagerness
of the People to run after him was soon abated;
they began in a short time after his Arrival,
to be indifferent whether they saw him or
not; and at length, they were so weary of him,
that every body wish'd publickly that he was
gone.</p>

<p>I have had the Honor to acquaint you, that the
Electoral Prince of <i>Saxony</i> was at the <i>Persian</i>'s Audience.
This Prince had been for some time in
<i>France</i>; and tho' he was <i>incog.</i> by the Name or
Title of the Count of <i>Lusatia</i>, he had the Retinue
of a King's Son. The Count <i>de Coste</i>, who died
Bishop of <i>Warmia</i>, was his Governor, and the
Baron <i>de Hagen</i> his Sub-Governor. He had also
several Gentlemen with him, besides Pages, and
a number of Officers. His Equipage was magnificent,
and his Table as elegant as could be
desir'd. He was presented to the King by <i>Madame</i>,<!--276.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
who gave him out to be a <i>German</i> Gentleman
of a good Family.</p>

<p>This Prince gave a sumptuous Ball at the
Hotel <i>de Soissons</i>, in the Apartment where <i>Dumont</i>
the Envoy of <i>Holstein</i> liv'd. There was
an amazing Croud of Masqueraders, and among
the rest your humble Servant, who had good
Diversion there with a Lady who trusted me
with a Secret, by mistake, for another Person.
As she is a Lady of some Distinction, you'll excuse
me from telling her Name. All that I
shall do my self the Honor to acquaint you of
at present is, that she was a Duchess who was
fond of <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> to Distraction; but he had abandon'd
her for Mademoiselle <i>de S&mdash;&mdash;</i>. The
Duchess saw him enter the Ball-Room with <i>V&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
who was formerly a Confident of their Amours,
and an intimate Friend of <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i>. The Duchess,
as disguis'd as she was, was presently known by her
faithless Lover; so that when she went to lay hold
of him, he slily stole away with his Friend, and
secreted himself in the Croud. Being afraid of
Reproaches from the Duchess, he thought fit also
to change his Domino. <i>V&mdash;&mdash;</i> likewise exchang'd
his for mine. <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> shew'd me the
Place where he had seen the Duchess, and desir'd
me to pass by her, but not to speak to her, in
case that she offered to talk with me. I promis'd
every thing he ask'd, yet was resolv'd to have a
Parley with her, if I found a proper Opportunity,
which soon presented. You must know,
that I so much resembled M. <i>de V&mdash;&mdash;</i> in Stature,
that the Duchess readily took me for him, and
beckoning me aside, at the Instant that she was
in high Wrath with <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, for refusing to speak
to her, she made a general Confession to me of
all her Intrigue. While she was going on thus,<!--277.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
without Reserve, to make a Variety of Confessions
to me, of which I thought she might repent
when she knew that she had been speaking
to the wrong Person; I interrupted her by saying,
<i>She was mistaken in her Man, and that I
was not</i> V&mdash;&mdash;. She reply'd hastily, <i>What need all
these Grimaces? Hear me out to the End of my Tale.
This is not a Place to play the fool in. You know</i>, continu'd
she, <i>that I have granted the ungrateful Man
but every thing</i>. I broke in upon her again, and said
to her, <i>By my Troth</i>, Madame, <i>I did not know one
word of the Matter till now</i>. She jeer'd me for
pretending to be ignorant of what she had been
telling me, and continu'd her Discourse to me
with all the Plainness and True-heartedness that
is seldom found in Narratives of this nature.
After she had run on a good while, she said,
<i>Alas!</i> Sir, <i>What say you, Speak, now is your Time
to speak, and justify your Friend, if you can. I
really think</i>, replied I, <i>that <span class="f">R&mdash;&mdash;</span> is a Scoundrel
to set so little a Value upon the Kindness you have
for him; and instead of justifying him, when I
see him, I shall certainly rattle him for it. I shall
tell him every Tittle that you have now done me the
Honor to divulge to me; and tho' I am not <span class="f">V&mdash;&mdash;</span>, nor
very intimate with <span class="f">R&mdash;&mdash;</span>, I am persuaded
that he will give Attention to what I shall say to
him. Ah, Sir!</i> replied the Duchess, <i>Why do ye
go to alter the natural Tone of your Voice? How
can you deny your self? What have I done to be
thus treated? Upon my Honor, Madam</i> I said, <i>I don't
impose on you; let your own Eyes be Witness</i>. At
the same Moment I pull'd off my Mask. The
Lady was so astonish'd that I can't express it.
She cou'd not speak; and I perceiv'd, by her
Confusion for having made such an open Confession
to me, that she did not know, whether she<!--278.png--><span class="pagenum">272</span>
had best say on, or retire? I really pitied her,
and did all I could to hearten her. I begg'd her
to be assur'd that I would keep every thing she
had said to me inviolably secret; and that I
was as sensible as she could be, of the Consequence
of revealing Things of that nature. The
good Lady began to pluck up her Spirits; and
after some farther Discourse she desir'd me to
hand her out, and to help her to find her Coach.
It was impossible to discover her Coach or mine
either in the Croud; and therefore she chose to
take a Hack. I went with her to her House,
where she desir'd me to go back to the Ball, and
tell the Ladies whom I had seen in her Company
that she was taken very ill. I obey'd her Orders
punctually, and did not fail next Day to
pay her a Visit, and this Visit pav'd the way for
others, which gave me an Opportunity to contract
a most intimate Acquaintance with her.
I had the Honor, in short, of being her most
esteemed Friend, and found her possess'd of a
thousand good Qualities, which render'd her the
best Companion in the World.</p>

<p>The most comical part of this Adventure was,
to find <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> quarrelling bitterly with the Duchess
for holding a long Parley with a Gentleman in
Masquerade at the Ball. He pretended to be
jealous, and wrote a thundering Letter to her
next day, wherein he told her, that he would
have nothing more to do with her. On the other
hand Madam <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, with whom I went
to the Ball, and whom I was still passionately
fond of, took advantage of the Conference I
had with the Duchess, and also pretended Jealousy,
(for to be serious, I knew afterwards that
'twas only a Copy of her Countenance.) She expatiated
a good deal upon her Uneasiness at the<!--279.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
long Conversation that pass'd betwixt us. I
was silly enough to believe that she was sincere
in what she said, and more Fool still to be
transported with the Thought that I had made
her jealous. I did all in my power, however,
to remove her Suspicions; in a word, I said every
thing that a Lover can say, who loves sincerely,
and would convince that he does so. She
seem'd to be satisfy'd with my Protestations;
but yet instead of making a suitable Return to
the Respect I had for her, she continu'd to teaze
me all the rest of the Winter. Her Behavior
was so extremely coquetish, that it gave me a
deal of Vexation; and besides, I did not like to
see the Marquis <i>de V&mdash;&mdash;</i> so often at her
House.</p>

<p>I had been pester'd with this Marquis for a
long time. 'Twas he that took away <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> from
me; and no sooner was I got into the Favor
of Madame <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, but he found a way
to insinuate himself there too. I was so provok'd
to see him always at my Heels, that I
quarrel'd with him one day at <i>C&mdash;&mdash;</i>, where
we happen'd to meet at the House of the President
<i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i>. We were actually at Daggers-drawing,
when M. <i>de C&mdash;&mdash;</i> came and parted
us. <i>V&mdash;&mdash;</i> assur'd me that he had no manner
of Pretence to Madame <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, and actually
promis'd me, that if I did not like his Visits to
her, he would not renew them. And he was
as good as his Word, so that I was perfectly reconcil'd
to him; but I was not at all pleas'd
with Madam <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>. I saw plainly that I
was betray'd. I had fresh Cause to suspect her
every day, and yet I hugged the Chains wherewith
she had bound me; in which I sufficiently
confuted the vulgar Error of those who assert,<!--280.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
that People never love heartily but once. I
ought, however, to reflect a little upon this last
Amour, which was extremely hurtful to me.
Madam <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i> was so extravagant that a
Man could not be upon good Terms with her,
without being, at an excessive Expence. To
support my self I borrow'd Money every where,
till e'er long I knew not where to find Lenders.
On the other hand my Creditors began to make
me frequent Visits, till they were tir'd with my
continually putting them off from one time to
another, and then truly they resolv'd to proceed
against me by Law; and at length took
out a Writ to attach my Person. I was very
much stunn'd at the News, but because I had
put them in an ill Humor, I was willing to avoid
the Effects of it, by keeping my Chamber
for some days, till M. <i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i> had procur'd
me an Order to stay Prosecution. This Respite
put me upon ways and means to find Money,
all my Desire being to satisfy my Creditors. I
was aware how difficult it was to get a sufficient
Sum to pay them remitted from home; for all
my Estate was entail'd upon my Brother and
Mademoiselle <i>de Pollnitz</i>; and she never intended
to give her Consent to the mortgaging of any
part of it. Yet having no other way to bring my
self out of Trouble, I got my Friends to intercede
with her; which they did so powerfully,
that at length they really prevail'd on her to
agree to the borrowing of some Money upon
the Estate, which was lent accordingly; and by
this Means I got happily out of this Scrape.
The Difficulties I had been plung'd in made me
wiser, and I lessen'd my Expences, which I perceiv'd,
indeed, was not the way to preserve the
Favor of Madam <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>. But what should I do?<!--281.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
To dip my self again over head and ears in
Debt, and to run the risque of having another
scurvy Action enter'd against me, was what I
could not resolve on. At this same time I obtain'd
a Pension of 2000 Livres; but as to an
Employment, none could I get of the Secretary
at War.</p>

<p>This put me so much out of Temper, that
notwithstanding my Passion for Madam <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
and my being so much attach'd to <i>France</i>, I
determin'd to try once more for an Establishment
elsewhere. For this purpose I wrote to
the Prince of <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i>, a General Officer in the
Emperor's Service, and a Colonel of a Regiment
of Foot, who return'd me a very obliging Answer,
how glad he should be to admit me into
his Regiment; but that there was no Company
vacant in it, nor none like to be, unless I could
strike a Bargain with a certain old Captain who
had a Design to retire, and would gladly part
with his Company for 2000 Crowns. To
find such a round Sum as 2000 Crowns, in the
Situation which I was in then, and to find the
Philosopher's Stone, was as easy for me one as
the other. I resolv'd, however, to treat with
the Captain.</p>

<p>I therefore set out for <i>Bruges</i>, where the
Prince of <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> was in Garison with his Regiment.
I met with a Captain, but he was pretty
stiff, and would absolutely hear of no Terms
but the Money down, or old Plate for Security.
The Prince, who really wish'd me well, and
perfectly knew the State of my Affairs, wrote
to my Cousin to persuade her to consent to my
taking up some more Money upon the Estate.
I also indited the most moving Letter I could, to
melt her; but 'twas all to no purpose: The Answers<!--282.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
she return'd were very sarcastical. She set
me off to the Life, and she had the Art to persuade
the Prince who had wrote to her, that to
give me Leave to borrow more Money, was
to put a Sword into the Hands of a Mad-man.
For my own part I was in a manner convinc'd
that she had Reason on her side. I therefore
quitted all Thoughts of the Company which I
propos'd to buy, and set out for <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>I was not sorry to leave <span class="smcap">Bruges</span><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, it being
one of the saddest Places in the <i>Netherlands</i> for
a Man to live in, who is not a Merchant; yet
'tis a very considerable City. 'Tis said to be
very ancient, and that it was encompass'd with
Walls in the Year 865. It was formerly dependant
on the Bishopric of <i>Tournay</i>; but since
the Reign of <i>Philip</i> II. it has been erected into
a Bishop's See, which is now Suffragan to the
Archbishopric of <i>Mechlin</i>. Its Cathedral, which
is dedicated to St. <i>Donat</i>, is a very old and a
very fine Structure. The other Churches are also
of an elegant Model, especially the <i>Jesuits</i>
Church and our <i>Lady</i>'s. In the latter there's
the Tomb of <i>Charles</i> the <i>Bold</i> the last Duke of
<i>Burgundy</i> who was kill'd before <i>Nancy</i>, from
whence his Corpse was translated hither, by order
of <i>Mary</i> of <i>Austria</i>, his Grandaughter, the Widow
of a King of <i>Hungary</i> and Sister to the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> V. The Situation of <i>Bruges</i> is very
advantagious, it being but three Leagues from
the Sea; and for the Ease of its Trade there
are several Canals cut in it, on which Vessels pass
to and fro as they do in <i>Holland</i>; with this Conveniency
moreover, that People dine there as elegantly
as in the best Tavern. Tho' all these<!--283.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Canals have a Communication with the Sea,
yet their Waters are not fast, by reason of the
Sluices and other Machines, which they make
use of to prevent it. 'Tis natural to suppose,
that Fields in which so many Canals are cut,
must be fertile; yet the Trade of <i>Bruges</i> is very
much dwindled since the flourishing of that of
<i>Amsterdam</i>, which has engross'd it all to it self.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you, that 'twas at <i>Burges</i> the
Order of the Golden Fleece was instituted by
<i>Philip</i> the <i>Good</i>, Duke of <i>Burgundy</i> on the
very Day that he consummated his Marriage
with <i>Isabel</i> the Daughter of <i>John</i> King of <i>Portugal</i>.
'Twas to this City also that <i>Charles</i> II.
King of <i>England</i> came for Refuge, when his
Subjects rebell'd against him; and so well was he
receiv'd here, that when he was in peaceable
Possession of his Throne he shew'd his Gratitude,
by permitting the Citizens to send fifty Vessels
every year to the Coasts of <i>England</i>, to catch
Herrings. So much, <i>Madame</i>, for <i>Bruges</i>.</p>

<p>Just as I was setting out, I heard that the
Prince of <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> was going for <span class="smcap">Newport</span><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>,
where there was a Battalion of his Regiment in
Garison; and thither I went with him. This, which
is a very ancient Town, was heretofore intirely
destroy'd by the <i>English</i>, and afterwards rebuilt
by <i>Philip</i> the <i>Bold</i>, Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>.
The Rebels of <i>Ghent</i> burnt it in 1383, because
it continued faithful to its Sovereign. It held
out a very sharp Siege by the <i>French</i>, in which
the Women display'd a very great share of
Valour. During the Revolt of the <i>Netherlands</i>
it submitted to the Prince of <i>Parma</i>. In that
same War, the <i>Dutch</i> who were besieging it,<!--284.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
under Prince <i>Maurice</i> of <i>Orange</i>, gain'd a great
Victory over the <i>Spaniards</i>, at the Gates of the
Town; and yet they thought fit to raise the
Siege. They say, that with some Expence
<i>Newport</i> might be made one of the best Harbors
in the Ocean; and a Plan for this purpose was
given to the Marquis <i>de Priè</i>, Commandant in
the <i>Netherlands</i>; but hitherto it has not been
approv'd of. Tho' 'tis a Town not very much
fortify'd, yet 'tis a strong Place considering the
Advantage it has of laying all the Country round
it under Water. 'Tis quite encompass'd with
Downs and Marshes, the former of which abound
with Rabbets. The Prince of <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> gave
me the Pleasure of Hunting there, which is the
only Diversion that can be taken by Officers
who are condemn'd to be in Garison in such a
Hole as <i>Newport</i>. We staid there two Days,
after which the Prince and Princess of <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i> return'd
to <i>Bruges</i>. For my own part I accompanied
the Prince of <i>Holstein</i> to <span class="smcap">Ypres</span>, of
which he is Governor for the <i>Dutch</i>.</p>

<p>This is one of the best Cities in <i>Europe</i>, and is
notable for having suffer'd several Sieges. The
Rebels made themselves Masters of it in the Reign
of <i>Philip</i> II. when they plundered the Churches
and Convents, and drove out the Fryars. The
Archduke <i>Leopold</i> retook it from those Furiosos,
and it remained in Possession of <i>Spain</i> till 1658,
when 'twas taken by the Marshal <i>de Turenne</i>;
but by the <i>Pyrenean</i> Treaty it reverted to its
lawful Sovereign. In 1678, <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
besieg'd it in Person and took it; and by
the Treaty of <i>Nimeguen</i>, which was concluded
the same year, 'twas yielded to him by <i>Spain</i>.
The <i>French</i> caus'd it to be considerably fortify'd;
after which they remain'd peaceable Possessors<!--285.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
of it till the Peace of <i>Utrecht</i>, when they
yielded it to the Allies, in exchange for <i>Lisle</i>
which had been taken from the <i>French</i>. <i>Ypres</i>
is now a Barrier for the <i>Dutch</i>, who keep a
good Garison in it. Nevertheless, Justice is administer'd,
and the Taxes raised here, in the Name
of the Emperor, as Sovereign of <i>Spanish Flanders</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Ypres</i> I went to <i>Lisle</i>, of which I have
already had the Honor to give you some Account;
and from <i>Lisle</i> in a very short time I
proceeded to <span class="smcap">Paris</span>. Who should I see there,
but the famous Countess of <i>Wartemberg</i>? The
Chevalier <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i>, who being at <i>Utrecht</i> during
the Congress, had there sign'd a Contract to
marry her, returning to <i>France</i> as soon as the
Peace was concluded, the Countess follow'd him
and came to <i>Versailles</i>, where she had the Honor
of waiting on the King. She wore the Pictures
of three Kings as a Bracelet on her Arm,
which she shew'd to the King, telling him at
the same time, <i>That after she had seen three Monarchs
at her Feet, she was now come from the
Heart of</i> Germany <i>to throw her self at the Feet
of his Majesty</i>. The King, who was surpriz'd at
the Compliment, star'd at her, but said not a
Word. Some days after this she appear'd at the
Play-house, stuck all over with Diamonds; and
those so large, that she was call'd, <i>The Lady of
precious Stones</i>. All the young Fellows combin'd
to have a Pluck at her, and every younger Brother
of a Family thought those Diamonds would
look as well upon him as they did upon the Countess.
When they had pilfer'd some from her,
she was more cautious how she paraded with
'em for the future. Yet notwithstanding all her
Care, the Chevalier <i>de B&mdash;&mdash;</i> dextrously stripp'd
her of all she had in one day. He had been for<!--286.png--><span class="pagenum">280</span>
some time wishing that he could revoke the Marriage-Contract
which he had sign'd with the
Countess; his Family also press'd him to break
off his Engagement with her; and in fine, not
knowing what Course to take to recover the
Contract, which the Lady refus'd to restore,
he made use of this very singular Expedient.
One day when he was at <i>Versailles</i>, he set out
Post from thence to find out the Countess of
<i>Wartemberg</i>, and told her that the King had just
receiv'd an Express from <i>Berlin</i>, by which the
King of <i>Prussia</i> desir'd him to put her under
an Arrest, and to seize her Diamonds, and other
Effects, as having been stole from the King his
Father. <i>I just had the News</i>, said the Chevalier
to her, <i>from M.</i> de T&mdash;&mdash;, <i>who knowing the Respect
I have for you, was willing to give me an
Opportunity of doing you Service, by guarding you
from the Misfortune that threatens you</i>. The
Countess being thunder-struck at this News,
said to the Chevalier in a Fright, <i>O my God!
What shall we do? Your only way</i>, said he, <i>is to
give me Charge of all your Diamonds; your Interests
and mine are the same; I don't believe you
suspect me; I will carry them all to my Father's
House, where they will be safe: And as for your
Person, you may be very easy; for M.</i> de T&mdash;&mdash;
<i>has assur'd me, that 'tis your Effects they want,
and not your Person</i>. Madame <i>de Wartemberg</i>
believ'd every Tittle of what he said, and esteeming
the Chevalier as her Guardian Angel,
she deliver'd up all her Diamonds to him, with
every thing besides of most Value. <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i> having
all this Booty, took his Leave of her. The
Countess thought she had play'd a very cunning
Part in thus securing her Effects; but 'twas not
long before she was sensible that she had play'd<!--287.png--><span class="pagenum">281</span>
a foolish one. <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i> was not to be seen for four or
five days. The Countess, startled at his absenting
himself, wrote Letter after Letter to him, but could
not obtain so much as one Answer. At last, on
the fifth day, <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i> made his Appearance, and
gave the good Lady some Encouragement. He
told her that her Jewels were all safe; and that
she might have them whenever she pleas'd, upon
this trifling Condition only; namely, that she
would restore him the Contract he had sign'd to
marry her. The Countess extremely surpriz'd
at this Compliment, made Answer to the Chevalier,
That Princesses of the Empire were not
to be thus treated; that she was come to <i>Paris</i>
upon his Engagement to marry her; and that
she knew how to oblige him to it. <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i>, who
was resolv'd to break with her at any rate,
told her, that she was at her full Liberty to chuse
either of these two Proposals that he made to
her, <i>viz.</i> To go to Law, and thereby to be certain
of losing her Effects; or else, to recover
them, by restoring that Paper to him which he
demanded. He made her sensible, that by going
to Law, he might naturally hope to get the
better of her, not only from the Justice of his
Cause, but from the Interest of his Relations;
and that as to her Effects, since there was no
Witness that saw her deliver them into his
Hands, he should take a Course which she would
think pretty hard, <i>viz.</i> Deny that he had ever
receiv'd them, and in the mean time sell one
part of the Jewels to enable him to find Law
to keep the rest. The Countess perceiving that
the Chevalier was resolv'd to be as good as his
Word, and that she had no Chance to get any
thing, determin'd to give up the Contract;
and <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i> thereupon brought back her Diamonds;<!--288.png--><span class="pagenum">282</span>
which was such an honest Action on his
part, that it engag'd Madam <i>de Wartemberg</i> to
make him a Present of a noble Ring, valu'd at
20,000 Livres. And thus ended her Correspondence
with <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i>.</p>

<p>The Countess, to make her self easy for the
Loss of her Lover, resolv'd to look out for others;
but she was not happy in the Variety of
her Choice. <i>They were all</i>, said she, <i>insincere;
and for the most part knavishly inclin'd</i>. In short,
she renounc'd all manner of Society with <i>Frenchmen</i>;
she thought them too volatile and nimble
for her, and upon this Occasion she extol'd the
<i>Germans</i> for the honestest Souls in the World;
yet she soon found the contrary, to her Cost:
For having made an Acquaintance with a clever
handsome young <i>German</i>, they both promis'd each
other Marriage, as soon as they came to a Protestant
Country, and a Contract was actually sign'd between
them for that purpose; but the Spark thought
that after they had sign'd and seal'd, the Nuptial
Benediction was only an insignificant Ceremony
to admit them into a Partnership in their worldly
Goods; and that his Right ought to commence
from the very day that the Articles were
agreed to. Upon this Principle he thought fit
to march off with all the precious Stones of his
Spouse that was to be, and set out with them
from <i>Paris</i>, designing to elope to <i>Lorrain</i>. The
Countess, who was soon inform'd of his Departure,
was mortally uneasy at the Treachery of
her Lover, tho' the Danger she was in of losing
her Diamonds stuck most to her Heart. By
good Luck she had Intelligence what Road her
dear Thief went, and sent a Messenger after him,
who found him at <i>Meaux</i>, where he was so unwise
as to make a Halt for some days. He was<!--289.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
brought back to <i>Paris</i>, where the Countess,
who denied that she had ever made the least
Proposal of Marriage to the Stripling, was preparing
to swinge him; but the Electoral Prince of
<i>Saxony</i>, by whom he was protected, put a stop
to all further Prosecution, and caus'd the Jewels
to be restor'd to Madam <i>de Wartemberg</i>, who
did not insist upon his Promise of Marriage; for
being of a Temper that did not permit her to be
idle, she had already contracted a clandestine
Marriage with <i>F&mdash;&mdash;</i>. These various Intrigues
happening so soon one after another, were so
much talk'd of, that the Countess did not think
fit to stay any longer in <i>France</i>, but set out for
<i>Holland</i>, where she remains to this day<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the Close of the Year, <i>viz.</i> on the
1st of <i>September</i> 1715, <i>France</i> lost <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
He died a Death truly Christian, for which he
had been some time before preparing himself;
so that when Notice was given him, that he
must make ready to go out of this World, he
was not at all surpriz'd. He took his last Farewel
of his Family with a Courage worthy of
Admiration. He gave his Blessing to the young
Dauphin, the Heir of his Crown; which he
accompanied with several important Advices and
Exhortations, especially not to go to War without
a just Cause, and not to be so fond of it as
he had been. Then he ordered what Mourning
the young Monarch should wear, adding, that
what he prescrib'd to him was the same that he
wore at the Death of the King his Father. This
Monarch express'd a vast Affection for the Princes
of his Family, and strongly recommended
his Successor to the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>. They say<!--290.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
that he stretch'd forth his Hand to the Marshal <i>de
Villeroy</i>, and said to him, <i>Adieu, my Friend, we
must part</i>. Madame <i>de Maintenon</i> staid with
the King all the Time of his Illness, because he
desir'd it, except one Day, when the King being
so ill that they thought he could not recover it,
she return'd to <i>St. Cyr</i>; but as soon as the Monarch
came to himself, and found Madame <i>de
Maintenon</i> gone, he sent for her, and begg'd her
not to forsake him. Accordingly she continu'd
with him till his Death, upon which she went
back to <i>St. Cyr</i>, where she liv'd mightily retir'd
till 1719, when she died.</p>

<p>'Tis astonishing to think what a Change there
was at Court upon the Death of <i>Lewis</i> XIV.
The Courtiers stuck fast to him, to the very last
Moment of his Life, not at all minding the Princes;
no, not even the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>: but
the very Moment that the King died, the Face of
every thing was alter'd; and all the Court was
made to the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, as the sole Dispenser
of Favors, who went, accompanied by all
the Princes and Courtiers, to the young Monarch,
and paid him the due Homage.</p>

<p><i>Lewis</i> XIV. had appointed the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>
Regent of the Kingdom by his last Will;
but at the same time he nominated several Noblemen
for Associates in the Government, without
whom he could conclude nothing. He also depriv'd
him of the Guardianship of the young
King, and gave it to the Duke <i>de Maine</i>; in a
word, he bound his Hands in such a manner,
that this Prince had nothing but the Shadow
of the Regency. The Duke, however, artfully
procur'd that Honor to be paid to him, which
he claim'd as his due. He conducted the young
King to Parliament with a great Train. The<!--291.png--><span class="pagenum">285</span>
<i>French</i> and <i>Swiss</i> Guards being drawn up in a
Line in the Streets, to the very Gates of the
Palais or Parliament-House, the <i>Gens d'Arms</i>, Musketeers,
Light-Horse and Life-Guards attended
his Majesty to the Palais, where he was receiv'd
with the usual Ceremonies, and conducted
to the Court, which they call his <i>Bed</i> of
Justice. When every body had taken their
Seats, the Duke of <i>Orleans</i> broke silence and
said, <i>That tho' the Regency belonged to him by
Birth-right, yet he was very glad he could
produce the Codicil of the late King to them in
proof of it; which having caus'd to be read, together
with the Will, he shew'd the Inconveniencies
that might arise from the little Authority
which was given to him; and that his Rank and
Birth had always intitled him to hope for more</i>.
And having said this, he demanded of the Parliament,
<i>Whether they did not own him for the
Sovereign Administrator of the Kingdom</i>. He
added, <i>That whatever Authority should be given
him, he should be glad to follow the Advice of the
Parliament; that he would share his Authority
with the Grandees of the Kingdom; and that if
there should happen to be a Failure of Justice in his
Administration, it would then be a Pleasure to
him to bear their Remonstrances</i>. He clos'd all
with saying, <i>That he should like well enough to
have his Hands restrained from doing wrong, but
that he wish'd they might be at entire Liberty to
do good</i>. The Votes ran in his Favor; the
late King's Will was annull'd, the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>
declared Regent of the Kingdom, and
Guardian of the King; and the Superintendancy
of his Majesty's Education was given to the
Duke of <i>Maine</i>. The Regent return'd his
Thanks to the Parliament; and at the same<!--292.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
time told them, <i>that he was for pursuing a Plan
of Government that was found among the Papers of
the Duke of <span class="f">Burgundy</span>, Father to the present King;
according to which Plan it appeared that the said
Prince had a Design to establish Councils for every
Province, whether of the Finances, War, Admiralty,
&amp;c. and to be governed entirely by what the
Majority of the Voices therein should determine</i>.</p>

<p>The Duke <i>du Maine</i> had no reason to be satisfy'd
with this Assembly; for besides being depriv'd
of the Guardianship of the King, he had
much ado to preserve the Prerogatives which
the late King had annex'd to the Quality of a
legitimated Prince of the Blood. The Dukes
and Peers declared immediately against the Precedency
that had been granted to those Princes,
and carried their Complaints to the Bed of Justice,
where they demanded that they might only
be considered as a Part of their Body; and
that they might be allow'd no other Rank than
what they deriv'd from their Peerages. Hereafter
we shall also find the Princes of the Blood
declaring against those Princes that had been legitimated.</p>

<p>This Demand of the Dukes did not take
place at that time, no more than another which
they also made upon the same Day, <i>viz.</i> that the
first President, when he ask'd their Opinion in
Parliament, should veil the Bonnet to them, in
the same manner as to the Princes of the Blood.
The Duke of <i>Orleans</i> desir'd them to permit the
Usages of Parliament to be observ'd on that Day,
and assured them that he would decide that Affair
very shortly. The President <i>de Novion</i>, afterwards
the first President, then spoke, and answered
the Regent, that his Royal Highness had
no Right to make a Decision in an Affair which<!--293.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
related directly to the Person of the King,
whom the Parliament had the Honor of representing
in his Majesty's Absence; and that consequently
nothing could be alter'd in the Usage
of Parliament, but by the King himself when he
came of Age.</p>

<p>After the Court of Justice broke up, the King
return'd to <i>Vincennes</i>, where he resided after the
Death of the late King, till the Palace of the
<i>Thuilleries</i> was made fit for his Reception. The
Regent and the Princes accompanied the King,
and they afterwards went back to <i>Paris</i>, each
Man to his own House. They say that the
Duke of <i>Maine</i> was no sooner return'd home,
but the Duchess his Wife, impatient to know
what had pass'd in the Bed of Justice, came that
very instant to ask him what News he brought;
and when he told her, that the Regent was the
sole Master of the King and Kingdom, she reproach'd
him bitterly.</p>

<p>As soon as the <i>Louvre</i> was in a readiness the
King set out thither from <i>Vincennes</i>, where
Lodgings were laid out for the Princes and
Princesses of the Blood. The Palace of <i>Luxemburg</i>
was given to the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>, who
made great Alterations in the Apartments.
This Princess had a mighty Ascendant over her
Father the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, and she made such a
use of it that there was not a day but she obtain'd
new Favors. As she was the first Princess in
the Kingdom, there being at that time no
Queen, she desir'd to have a Captain of the
Guards to attend her; a Privilege which none
had ever enjoy'd before but the Queens. The
Duke of <i>Orleans</i> could not deny her, and the
Person invested with this Character was the Marquis
<i>de la Rochefoucault</i>. Madame no sooner<!--294.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
heard of this Augmentation of Officers in the
Houshold of the Duchess her Daughter, but she
presently appointed M. <i>de Harling</i> to be Captain
of her Guards, who was a <i>German</i> Gentleman
that had been her Page. The Duchess of
<i>Berry</i> wanted also to be stil'd <i>Madame</i> as well
as the Princess her Mother; yet to prevent
Confusion she signify'd, that when they made
mention of her they should not call her <i>Madame
la Duchesse de Berry</i>, but <i>Madame, Duchesse de
Berry</i>. Moreover, she pretended to the Right
of having Kettle-Drums and Trumpets sounded
before her when she went abroad in Ceremony,
tho' this was never observ'd to any body but
the Queen. In short, this Princess enter'd once
into <i>Paris</i> with all this Attendance, as she return'd
from <i>la Muette</i>. When she pass'd before
the Palace of the <i>Thuilleries</i>, the Officers of the
Guards were very much astonish'd to hear the
Trumpets, and represented that no body but
the King and Queen ought to march with such
Pomp; upon which Madame <i>de Berry</i> wav'd her
Privilege for the future, tho' with regard only
to <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>Some will imagine, perhaps, that this Princess,
who was so fond of Grandeur, must naturally
be difficult of Access and of very stiff Behavior
to Persons that had the Honor of approaching
her. Yet she was quite the Reverse. I
was acquainted with several Ladies that had the
Honor of some Familiarity with her; and they
all assur'd me, that she was the best-natur'd
Princess in the World. She never stood upon
Formalities in point of Ceremonial with the
Generality of the Ladies, but freely permitted
them to come and visit her in a Scarf. 'Tis
true indeed that she did not affect Dress herself,<!--295.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
and consequently it would not have been
good Manners for the Princesses and Court-Ladies
to appear in a formal Dress, which she was
scarce ever seen in her self. <i>Madame</i>, as I have
already had the Honor to tell you, was much
more precise. She was always in the Court-Dress,
and never suffer'd any but Ladies that were
advanc'd in years, or such as were not in Health,
to appear before her in any other.</p>

<p>The Duke Regent, according to the Promise
he had made to the Parliament, when he held the
Bed of Justice, establish'd several Councils. There
was one which was call'd <i>The Council of the Regency</i>,
others for War, the Finances, the Marine,
and for Affairs Foreign. All the Ministers of
the late King were dismiss'd, except the Chancellor
<i>Voisin</i>, who kept his Post. M. <i>Desmaretz</i> and
M. <i>de Pontchartrain</i>, one the Minister of the
Finances, the other of Affairs Marine, were both
destitute of Employment. M. <i>Desmaretz</i> was
put to some trouble in a Chamber which the
Regent establish'd at the <i>Grand Augustins</i>, for
calling to account those who had had the Management
of the public Money. 'Twas called
the <i>Chamber of Justice</i>; and the President <i>Portail</i>,
who is now the first President, was at the
Head of it. Great Advantages were expected
from this Establishment, which would, they said,
not only pay off the King's Debts, but also bring
considerable Sums into his Coffers; nevertheless
it all came to nothing. There was a Fine
laid indeed, and 'twas a general one; but as most
of the Financiers had married their Daughters to
the Great Men of the Kingdom, they came off
for a Trifle; the Unfortunate paid for all:
Some were condemn'd to the Galleys, and others
to perpetual Imprisonment, after having been<!--296.png--><span class="pagenum">290</span>
set in the Pillory, where the People had the
Pleasure of insulting them; and that was all
they got by it. As for the King, he was not a
Penny the richer for it; and no body got more
by it than the Ladies who sollicited for the lowering
of the Fines, and ran away with almost all
the Profit. The Public, in general, was very
much perplex'd by it: Most People, afraid of
being fin'd, hid their Silver, which Metal so necessary,
became so scarce in but six Months time,
that it look'd as if <i>Lewis</i> XIV. had carried it all
out of the Kingdom with him to the other
World. They began to lament the Loss of
that Prince, and the Love of the Public for the
Regent vanish'd very fast, 'Twas not long before,
that every one thought they had reason
to curse the late King; and the <i>Frenchman</i>, who
is naturally fickle, imagin'd without knowing
why or wherefore, that the Death of <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. would be the beginning of a more happy
Century. The Prince who was at the Head of
the Administration was loaded with Blessings,
tho' he had not yet done any thing to win their
Hearts; and in a very short time this same
Prince, who was so much ador'd, found himself
the Subject of the most stinging Satire. He soon
took care to be inform'd how the Public stood
affected to him. I happen'd to be one day at <i>Madame</i>'s,
when this Prince declared aloud, <i>Six
Months ago</i>, said he, <i>I was perfectly ador'd in</i>
Paris, <i>tho' I had done nothing to deserve it; and
I am now as much hated, but for what reason I
should be glad to know</i>. He knew perhaps, or
at least he ought to have known it. The Scarcity
of Silver was the only Cause of it; and it
appeared by the Regent's Conduct, that the
King's Coffers were so far from being full, that<!--297.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Payments were made, not in Silver, but in Paper;
a Money always fluctuating, and with
which the <i>French</i> began to be tir'd. They had
so often seen Bills, with various Denominations;
and the Fare of the last sort call'd <i>Mint-Bills</i>,
in particular, was so fresh in their Memory, that
it was almost impossible they should entertain a
better Opinion of those that were created at the
beginning of the Regency, by the Name of <i>Government-Bills</i>:
Yet these were admitted notwithstanding
the great Clamor against them;
and by and by we shall find that the <i>French</i>,
who are always doom'd to be bubbled, gave into
a new Paper-Scheme, more specious perhaps
to view, but more ruinous in the Event, than
those which had appear'd before it.</p>

<p>Another thing which put the People out of
conceit with the Government, was the Fluctuation
of Measures at the Royal Palace, where nothing
was fix'd; and what was done one day,
was cancell'd the next. The Regent, who was
really a good-natur'd and very affable Prince,
seem'd to put himself into the hands of too
many People: No body that had a Favor to ask
was turn'd away; it often happen'd that the
same Thing was promis'd to two Persons, and a
third obtain'd it. Pensions, Gratuities and Employments
were promis'd, but the Promise seldom
kept: So far from it, that several Pensions
were suppress'd, and mine, which cost me so
much Pains in the Sollicitation, was of that number.
I made some Bustle to be put upon the
List again; yet all that I could obtain was a
Promise that my Pension should be renew'd
very soon: But the Performance is still to come.</p>

<p>All this striking off of Pensions, together
with a considerable Reduction of the Army, reduc'd<!--298.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
a great many People to Beggary. I saw
several Knights of St. <i>Lewis</i> at that very time,
waiting with Impatience for the Dusk of the Evening,
that they might go out, and beg Alms in
the public Places. This extreme Misery was attended,
as may be easily imagin'd, by Robberies
and Murders; so that all this while <i>Paris</i> had
a great Resemblance to a Wood. My Apprehension
that I should be a Sharer in the common
Desolation, engag'd me to pay my Court to
<i>Madame</i> with more Assiduity than ever, and I
earnestly intreated her to honor me with her
Recommendation to the Regent. The Princess
return'd me for Answer, <i>That she was resolv'd not
to meddle or make; that however I had no reason
to be uneasy; that there was no Necessity for her
speaking in my Behalf to the Prince her Son, since
he was naturally inclined to serve me; but that
for the present he was so over-burdened with Affairs
and Sollicitations, that I must have patience
for a while longer</i>. I made her Answer, <i>That I
was very willing to wait as long as her Royal
Highness pleas'd; but that I was sadly afraid I
was not in a Situation to stay long</i>. <i>Madame</i> reply'd
to me, <i>There is a Remedy for all Things:
Be you to-morrow at my Closet as soon as I have
din'd</i>. I was there punctually according to her
Orders, and found her all alone. As soon as she
saw me she said, <i>I am a poor Widow that can't do
great Matters for you, but I have a mind to oblige
you</i>. She then gave me the Key of her Bureau,
and bid me open it, and take a Bag out of
one Corner of it, in which there was Gold to the
Tune of three thousand Livres. I receiv'd it
with all the Gratitude possible; and this fresh
Token of her Royal Highness's Goodness attach'd
me to her more than ever.<!--299.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>The Dukes and Peers at this very time renew'd
a Demand which they had already made
in the Parliament, touching the Obeisance they
expected to be made to them by the first President
when he call'd for their Opinion: They
also claim'd several Prerogatives over the<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Nobility,
and wanted to establish themselves as a
Middle State between the Princes of the Blood
and those call'd Gentlemen. The Regent made
them Answer, <i>That for his part he had never
acknowledg'd more than three Orders, the Clergy,
the Nobility, and the third Estate; and that
'twas their Business to choose which Class they
would be of, without aiming at a chimerical Establishment
which was intirely unprecedented</i>.
The Dukes demanded moreover, to be excus'd
from drawing their Swords in any Quarrel with
a private Gentleman; but the Duke <i>de la Feuillade</i>
refus'd to sign this Petition, because he said,
<i>He would not be expos'd to an Affront from any
Gentleman, and he restrain'd from resenting
it</i>.</p>

<p>The Parliament did not vouchsafe to answer
the Memorial of the Dukes, and only confirm'd<!--300.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
what the President <i>de Novion</i> had advanc'd,
that it was the King's sole Right to determine
Claims of that sort, and that therefore they must
wait till his Majesty was of Age. The Nobility
did not treat the Demand of the Dukes with the
same Indifference as the Parliament, and met to
consider how they should behave; but there
came an Order forbidding them to continue
their Assemblies. Yet for all this Prohibition
they drew up a Memorial between themselves,
which was presented to the King. This Conduct
of theirs so disgusted the Court, that several
of the Nobles who were known to have the
greatest Hand in the Memorial were taken up
and committed to the <i>Bastile</i>. The Dukes met
at the same time at the House of the Archbishop of
<i>Rheims</i>, who was afterwards the Cardinal <i>de
Mailly</i>. In fine, the Result of all these Motions
on both sides, was a Declaration issued by his
Majesty, requiring that every thing should remain
in the same State as in the late King's
Life-time, without prejudice to the Rights of either
Party. A zealous Parliamentarian, who,
'tis like, could not brook that Pretensions so frivolous
as that of the Dukes should remain unanswer'd,
publish'd a very long Tract to prove,
that several of the Dukes were not Gentlemen;
and that the Generality of the Members of Parliament
were indisputably of better Extraction
than those who were grac'd with the Title of
Dukes. I question if <i>Henry</i> IV. who very often
did the Nobility the Honor to call himself a
Gentleman, would have left the Claim of the
Dukes undetermin'd.</p>

<p>At this very time the Princes of the Blood
presented a Petition to his Majesty against the Legitimated
Princes. The former were uneasy to<!--301.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
see the latter in possession of Rank equal to theirs,
and pretending to an equal Share with them in
the Right of Succession to the Crown; and
therefore demanded that the Legitimated Princes,
<i>viz.</i> the Duke <i>du Maine</i> and the Count <i>de Toulouse</i>,
and their Descendants, should be declar'd
to have forfeited the Rank of Princes of the
Blood; and that the Act by which the late
King declared those Princes capable of succeeding
to the Crown, should be struck out of the Registers
of the Parliament.</p>

<p>The Legitimated Princes presented a Memorial
to the King on their part, whereby they represented
to his Majesty, that the Demand of the
Princes of the Blood was contrary to his Authority;
that the Sovereigns had always the Liberty
of granting such Honors as they thought fit,
either to the Court or the Parliament; and that
moreover, the late King, when he declar'd them
Princes of the Blood, did it in the most authentic
Manner, the Declaration which gave them
that Dignity, being register'd in Parliament, in
the Presence, and even with the Advice of the
Princes of the Blood, and of the Dukes and
Peers.</p>

<p>Several Writings were publish'd at that time
on both sides of the Question, to prove the Justice
of the Cause which each maintain'd. The Amount
of what the Legitimated Princes pleaded
was, That Kings were the absolute Dispensers
of Favors; and that the Kings who were <i>Lewis</i>
XIVth's Predecessors, formerly granted those
very Privileges, which they now aim'd to
deprive them of, without Opposition. They
quoted for Example the <i>Longueville</i> Family,
whose Descendants had always the Rank of
Princes of the Blood. They also instanc'd in<!--302.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
several Bastards who had succeeded to the
Crown, in the first and second Race of the Kings
of <i>France</i>; and observ'd, that the Case would
have been the same in the third Race, if the
same Fact had happen'd.</p>

<p>The Princes of the Blood gave an ample and
solid Reply to the Memorial of the Legitimated
Princes. They advanc'd, that the King as great
as his Authority was, could not grant Prerogatives
that were peculiar only to Birth-right; that a
Bastard was one without Father, without Mother,
without Kindred, <i>&amp;c.</i> and by consequence
incapable of holding any Rank which Blood alone
can give; that moreover, the Claim of the
Legitimated Princes would deprive the Nation of
its Right of calling such Family to the Crown as
they thought fit, in case the Royal Family
should happen to be extinct.</p>

<p>This Memorial was confuted by another, and
to the latter there was a Reply. In fine, both
sides grew so warm, that to put an end to
the Quarrel, the King was oblig'd to speak.
He declared solemnly, <i>That the Legitimated
Princes should enjoy the Rank of Princes of the
Blood during their Lives, but that they could
not succeed to the Crown</i>. This Declaration was
very well receiv'd, in appearance, by both
Parties; but perhaps too it was the Cause of
some Events, which in the Consequence gave
the Regent no little Uneasiness, whereof I shall
soon have occasion to make mention.</p>

<p>During these Transactions in <i>France</i>, there
were Commotions of much greater Consequence in
<i>England</i>, where a Revolution was expected in
favor of the Chevalier <i>de St. George</i>, who having
spent some time at the Prince <i>de Vaudemont</i>'s
House at <i>Commercy</i> in <i>Lorrain</i>, was just set out<!--303.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
for <i>Scotland</i>. He embark'd between <i>Ostend</i> and
<i>Dunkirk</i>, and had a happy Passage. As soon as
he arriv'd he found a considerable Party which
declar'd for him. Every thing seem'd at first
to favor him: A great many Persons came to
own him for King, and he was serv'd in that
Quality. But his Happiness was of no long Duration,
and he was oblig'd to retire with Precipitancy
from a Country where he was in danger
of being ill us'd.</p>

<p>'Twas the Opinion of many People that this
Undertaking would have succeeded, if the Prince
had not discover'd so much Zeal for the Catholic
Religion; for 'twas only desired of him to
promise to preserve the Privileges of <i>Scotland</i> in
Religious Matters, but he would not hear of
it. Moreover, he rose one day from Table
without eating a Morsel, because a Clergyman
of the Church of <i>England</i> had said the Grace;
and upon this Occasion he protested, that he
would never eat a Bit of what a Heretic pretended
to give a Blessing to. This great Zeal for Religion,
a Zeal perhaps too flaming in Circumstances
where he might, without any Crime,
have smother'd it, was the reason that all the
Protestants in <i>Scotland</i>, many of whom had already
declared in his Favor, turn'd their backs
on him. I happen'd to be present when all this
was told to the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>. He made
Answer, <i>If all this be true, 'tis no wonder that
he has not succeeded; and I look upon him as an
undone Prince</i>. At the same time I observ'd
such an Air of Satisfaction in his and <i>Madame</i>'s
Countenances, as convinc'd me that they were
not ill pleas'd to see the Elector of <i>Hanover</i> establish'd
on the Throne of <i>England</i>.<!--304.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>The Chevalier <i>de St. George</i> return'd to <i>France</i>,
and having pass'd thro' the whole Kingdom <i>incog.</i>
he went for Refuge to <i>Avignon</i>. The <i>English</i>
did all they could with the Regent to engage
him to arrest the Chevalier, and demanded
likewise that he would cashier all the <i>English</i>
and <i>Irish</i> Officers in the Service of <i>France</i>, that
were the Pretender's Adherents. The Regent
satisfy'd them but in part, for he only cashier'd
the Officers. The Chevalier <i>de St. George</i>
was hotly pursu'd, and 'tis even said that a
certain Lord was a good while in chace of him,
with a Design to have killed him; but the Chevalier
escap'd the Danger by the Haste that
he made to <i>Avignon</i>. When he quitted <i>Scotland</i>
he was oblig'd to leave several Lords that had
follow'd him in the Lurch, particularly the
Duke of <i>Lirie</i>, Son to the Marshal <i>de Berwic</i>,
Natural Son of <i>James</i> II. who had so much
Difficulty to get to <i>France</i> again, that 'twas even
reported for a long while that he had been taken
Prisoner and beheaded, as Lord <i>Derwentwater</i>
was at <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> were sorry to see that Fortune
always cross'd the Chevalier <i>de St. George</i>, and
could not help pitying the Queen his Mother,
whose Sorrows were by this Disaster increas'd;
for she had, by the Miscarriage of this Expedition,
ruin'd several of her Friends, who had
made their utmost Efforts to support the Charges
of it.</p>

<p>Tho' the <i>Orleans</i> Family was not very much
afflicted at the Misfortune of the Chevalier <i>de
St. George</i>, yet it did not hinder <i>Madame</i> from
going to <i>Chaillot</i> to condole with the Queen
upon her late Misfortunes. I was at the Royal
Palace when <i>Madame</i> return'd from the Visit;<!--305.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
and she did me the Honor to tell me, <i>That she
had been almost crying her Eyes out</i>. I pretended
to be ignorant of the Cause of her Tears, and
took the Freedom to ask her, <i>What was the
matter? The poor Queen of <span class="f">England</span>!</i> said she,
<i>I pity her heartily. I have been weeping with
her</i>. I could not help letting <i>Madame</i> know
how much I was surpriz'd at this Grief of her's,
because I imagin'd she was more in the Interest
of the Family that govern'd <i>England</i>, than of a
Prince who was a Stranger to her; and one,
moreover, that was always out of Fortune's Favor.
<i>You are in the right</i>, said Madame, <i>all the
Relations of my late Aunt are dear to me, and I
with 'em well. But this poor Queen takes it as
much to heart as if it was but to-day that she
left the Crown. But what can she do? The only
way for her is to make her self easy. 'Tis not her
Doom to be happy; and since one of 'em must be
unfortunate, I had rather she was so than the
King of <span class="f">England</span>. But</i>, added she, <i>this must
not be told</i>. Madam <i>de D&mdash;&mdash;</i> coming in
just after these Words, <i>Madame</i> told her, <i>That
she had been to see the Queen of <span class="f">England</span>, but
that she thought she had been with the Nymph <span class="f">Arethusa</span> all the while</i>. Madam <i>de D&mdash;&mdash;</i> made
Answer to her, <i>That it was not surprizing to
see Tears shed by Persons so much afflicted as the
Queen was. What then</i>, said Madame, <i>are not
thirty Tears Misfortunes enough to inure her to
them</i>? Thus did this Princess wipe away the
Tears which lately fell from her in such a Torrent.</p>

<p>The fine Season being come, <i>Madame</i> went
to <i>St. Cloud</i>, and took with her Mademoiselle <i>de
Chartres</i> now the Abbess of <i>Chelles</i>, and Mademoiselle
<i>de Valois</i> now Princess of <i>Modena</i>.
<i>Madame</i> spent all the Summer at <i>St. Cloud</i>, so that I<!--306.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
made several Trips thither. I told her my Case, and
desir'd that she would please to intercede for me
with the Duke her Son. She always promis'd
me she would, but never did; and yet she said to
every body who talk'd of me to her, <i>That she
wish'd me well</i>; while, on the other hand, tho'
this Princess mortally hated <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> a <i>Prussian</i>
Gentleman, she earnestly importun'd the Duke
her Son to serve him; and I was present one day
when she sollicited for him. After the Duke of
<i>Orleans</i> retir'd, she call'd me to her, and said,
<i>You heard how I espous'd the Interests of <span class="f">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>, yet I
can assure you he does not deserve it</i>. Then <i>Madame</i>
told me strange Stories to the disadvantage of <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>, upon
which I took the Freedom to defend his
Cause, and to assure her Royal Highness that
he had been misrepresented to her. <i>What!</i> said
Madame, <i>will you offer to deny that he had his
Hand cut off for counterfeiting the Sign-Manual
of the King of <span class="f">Denmark</span>?</i> As I knew the Adventure
of <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> at the <i>Danish</i> Court, and that
his was not a Crime of such a nature; and as,
moreover, I knew that the Loss of his Right
Arm was owing to a Fall that he had receiv'd, I
represented to <i>Madame</i>, that I should have
thought the cutting off of his Hand Punishment
enough in all reason for the Crime of which
she suspected <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>; but that nevertheless, his
Arm was cut off near the Shoulder. <i>Alas</i>! said
the Princess, <i>that's because it was cut a second
time. But, Madame</i>, I instantly reply'd, <i>How
could your Royal Highness favor a Man that was
capable of such a Fraud? I have my Reasons for
it</i>, said she. I did not venture to indulge my Curiosity
further. But in fine, this M. <i>de S&mdash;&mdash;</i> who
was to the last degree abhorr'd, obtain'd what
he desir'd; whereas, for my part, as well as I<!--307.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
was wish'd, I could not possibly obtain so much as
a positive Denial, which would at least have
serv'd to undeceive me, and to make me look
out for Preferment from another Quarter.</p>

<p>While <i>Madame</i> was at <i>St. Cloud</i>, the Duchess
of <i>Berry</i> resided at <i>Meudon</i>, tho' sometimes she
came to <i>Paris</i>. I had the Honor of paying my
Compliments to this Princess very often. She
was good-natur'd and generous, and very free to
ask Favors of the Regent her Father, who seldom
deny'd her; so that whoever had her Protection,
was in a sure way to be advanc'd. The
Count <i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, a young Man of Quality, and
who was just enter'd as a Lieutenant in that
Princess's Guards, knew better than any body
how to gain his Mistress's Favor. I knew him
some time before this Preferment of his, when
he was a Lieutenant in the King's Regiment,
very much out at heels, and by consequence
not in a Condition to keep a certain Sett of Company;
at least, in the manner that he would
have desir'd: But by meer Chance he was quarter'd
upon the Duchess of <i>Berry</i>, who wanted a
Man of a good Family to be Lieutenant of
her Guards; for till then those who officiated
in that Post were only Persons of a common
Extraction, for which reason few there
were that strove to get it. <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> thought very
prudently, that in his present Circumstances he
was not oblig'd to mind such Scruples; and he
spoke to his Sister, who was a Lady of the Bed-Chamber
to the Duchess, of the Design he had
to offer his Service. He actually did so, and was
admitted. He perform'd the Duty of it a good
while, and the Princess took no more Notice of
him than she did of any of her other Officers.
What began to make him known was this. One<!--308.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
day as the Princess was going out she observ'd
that <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> was not on horseback by the side of
her Coach, as his Duty demanded of him; and
she complain'd of it to the Duke <i>de la Rochefoucault</i>
the Captain of her Guards. This Officer,
who was fond of <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, and was, moreover,
naturally inclin'd to do him Service, said to the
Princess that <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> was not well; but setting
his Indisposition aside, as he had the Honor to
be a Gentleman, he thought it hard to ride like
a Stable-Boy by the side of her Coach, while
several Officers of the Houshold, who were not
equal to him, rode in the Coach that follow'd.
The Duchess of <i>Berry</i>, who was a kind Mistress,
immediately gave Orders, that the Lieutenant
of her Guards should ride in the Waiting-Coach.
<i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> return'd her Thanks, and was more assiduous
than ever in his Attendance on her.
Madame <i>de M&mdash;&mdash;</i> spoke afterwards so
much in Commendation of <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, that the
Princess her self talk'd with him several times,
and was convinc'd that Madame <i>de M&mdash;&mdash;</i> had
told her the Truth, and that <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> deserv'd
her Favor. He was quickly Master of a splendid
Fortune, gay Furniture, Clothes and Equipage;
and she also preferr'd him to several Regiments,
which he always dispos'd of to his advantage.
To the Honor of <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> be it said,
that his Prosperity did not make him a jot the
vainer; he was still as good-natur'd and civil as
ever, his old Friends always found him the
same, and very often he did them important
Services. He had afterwards a Quarrel with the
Regent, who caus'd him to be banish'd from
his Regiment; and during his Exile the Duchess
of <i>Berry</i> died at <i>la Muette</i>, the 20th of <i>July,
1719</i>, aged only 24.<!--309.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>Mean time the King who had been at <i>Paris</i>
ever since his Return from <i>Vincennes</i>, was removed
out of the hands of the Women into those
of the Men, and the Person appointed for his
Governor was the Marshal <i>de Villeroy</i>. The
Choice of him was the more applauded, because
he was one of the old experienced Courtiers, and
a Man whose Zeal and Attachment to the King's
Person no body question'd. The Constitution of
this young Prince was so tender, that they could
not be too careful of it. The Marshal, as old
as he was, fully answer'd what was expected of
him: He gave extraordinary Application to the
discharge of his Duty, and was never out of
his Majesty's sight. This Nobleman's Post being
the most honorable that can be desir'd in
<i>France</i>, there quickly arose envious Persons,
who strove, tho' in vain, to depreciate him in
the Esteem of the Public. They confess'd that
he was a very proper Person to teach the young
Monarch to walk and make his Salute like a
King, to put his Hat on with a Grace, to accost
a Lady in the politest manner, and other things
of that nature; but that he was by no means
fit to inspire him with Ideas suitable to his Rank,
and that he could never make him think like a
King. But the consequence shew'd what the
Marshal was capable of, and the young Prince
quickly gave Proofs that he had learnt of the
Marshal not only to walk, but to think like a
King. I remember one Passage, which is a
very plain Indication of his being fully persuaded
that he was the sole Master in his Kingdom,
and that there was no Person above him. When
<i>Madame</i> came to the <i>Thuilleries</i>, she made but a
very short Visit at Court, because she went to
hear Mass; and she said to the King as she retired,<!--310.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
<i>That she was going to wait on a greater
Lord than he</i>. The young Prince seem'd a little
surpriz'd at first, but after a Moment's Reflexion
he made her Answer, <i>Undoubtedly</i>, Madame, <i>you
are going to pray to God</i>. Another day the
<i>French</i> Comedians having play'd the Tragedy
of <i>Athalia</i> before his Majesty, 'tis said the Prince
could not bear with any Patience to see young
<i>Joas</i> seated on the Throne, for he had a Fancy
that he was a second King; nor would he so
much as applaud the Lad who so perfectly well
play'd the Part of <i>Joas</i>. These Passages are a
sufficient Demonstration, that he had been inspir'd
with Sentiments suitable to his Dignity; and
that in time, perhaps, he will not be inferior in
any respect to his August Great-Grandfather.</p>

<p>As to my own Affairs, I had the Mortification
to find them still in the same Situation.
'Tis certain that no Sollicitation was
wanting on my part, nor Promises on the part
of the Regent; but after all, nothing was concluded,
and I was then not a whit forwarder
than when I arriv'd in <i>France</i>, tho' I had not
near so much Money. Mean time I was too
earnest for entring into the Service to be disheartened,
and shutting my Eyes against the Improbability
of Success, I renew'd my Sollicitation.
My Residence at <i>Paris</i> being extremely ruinous
to me, my particular Acquaintance could not
conceive how I was able to support my self.
Mademoiselle <i>de Pollnitz</i> soon heard that I had
not yet obtain'd any thing in <i>France</i>, and that
nevertheless I was obstinately bent on staying
there: She could not bear the Thoughts of the
Expence, which she was sensible I was oblig'd
to be at; and as my Estate was entail'd upon
her, she imagin'd that the Money I spent in<!--311.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
<i>France</i> was so much taken out of her Pocket.
She resolv'd therefore to make me quit <i>Paris</i>,
knowing very well that 'twas cheaper to live
elsewhere. For this end she desir'd the Princess
<i>de G&mdash;&mdash;</i>, who corresponded by Letters with
<i>Madame</i>, to write to her Royal Highness, and
to intreat her to protect me no longer, because
I did not deserve her Favors. The Letter was
accordingly written and sent to <i>Madame</i>, who
told me the whole Contents of it. 'Twas so
well cook'd up, that my Cousin might boast of
having a good Secretary. But her Royal Highness
assur'd me, that this Letter should make no
Impression upon her, and that she would always
be my Friend. I most humbly thank'd the
Princess, withdrew in a terrible Pet with my
Cousin; and in the first transport of my Passion
I wrote her a Letter, in which I did not spare
her. As she was really a Woman of very good
Sense, she answer'd me in the same Style. I replied;
she did the same; and thus we carried
on a Literary Correspondence, in which there
were very pretty Sayings on both sides.</p>

<p>To compleat my Happiness I was afflicted
with a Redundancy of Choler, which was follow'd
with the Jaundice, a Distemper that brought
me to the very Brink of the Grave. My Friends
did not forsake me; and among others I may
say, that I had more than ordinary Obligation
to the Abbé <i>d'Asfeldt</i>, who desir'd me to reflect
on my State; and as he knew that I was
not a Roman Catholic, and that the Prejudices
in which I had been bred up, gave me great
Prejudice to the contrary Party, he conjur'd me
to permit him to discourse me about Religion,
only one Hour in a Day; to which I consented
with pleasure. Every body knows with what<!--312.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
an Energy he speaks, and with what a winning
Grace. He continued his Visits all the time of
my Sickness, which by degrees went quite off.
I was so affected with what he said to me, that
I promised him I would receive Instruction
when I was recover'd; and as soon as I got abroad,
I was as good as my Word. He brought
me acquainted with Father <i>Denis</i>, a barefooted
<i>Carmelite</i>, who in some Conferences with me
finish'd what the Abbé <i>d'Asfeldt</i> had begun;
so that in a little time after, I made public
Profession of my Faith to Father <i>Denis</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, in
presence of an infinite number of Persons of
Quality. The Marquis <i>d'Asfeldt</i> and the Abbé
his Brother were my Witnesses, and sign'd my
Confession of Faith along with me. When the
Ceremony was ended, I was accosted on all sides
with Embraces from abundance of People, of
whom three parts in four were quite unknown
to me; yet their Zeal for Religion made them
fond of expressing how glad they were to see
me admitted into the Bosom of the Church.
I receiv'd the Communion the same Week, upon
the Festival of <i>All-Saints</i>: And at length I
waited on the Cardinal <i>de Noailles</i>, who made a
very fine Speech to me, exhorting me to continue
stedfast in the Religion that I had embrac'd.</p>

<p>The News of my Conversion was soon spread in
<i>Germany</i>, and <i>Luther</i> and <i>Calvin</i> themselves could
not have exclaim'd against it more than my good
Cousin did. The same Princess who had formerly
recommended me so heartily to <i>Madame</i>, wrote<!--313.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
to her again to tell her, <i>That she ought not to be surprised
at my changing my Religion, and that 'twas
nothing but a Ceremony which I had perform'd
two or three times before</i>. But tho' she gave it
this Turn, it made little or no Impression upon
<i>Madame</i>. And for my own part I did not give
much heed to what my Enemies said; and that
I might not be in the way of hearing it, I left
off going to the Royal Palace, where <i>Madame</i>
resided after she quitted <i>St. Cloud</i>.</p>

<p>I spent the Winter of 1717 very disagreeably,
that is to say, I wanted Money; and without
that current Metal, a Man may live as well in
the remotest Desert as in <i>Paris</i>. I was quickly
oblig'd to by down my Equipage, and at last to
sell some of my Clothes to satisfy my clamorous
Debtors: Yet for all this I could not stave off an
Affront from one of them, who to be sure was more
hungry than the rest; for tho' he had promis'd
to give me a Month longer, he caus'd me to be
arrested in the little Market of the Suburb of
<i>St. Germain</i>, and all at once was I hurried to
the Abbey. This might have prov'd a very fatal
Misfortune to me, if I had not been assisted
that very day by M. <i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i> a Counsellor of
Parliament, to whom I sent word of it the
very Moment I was in Hold; upon which he
came immediately, and offer'd his Bond for the
Debt: But my Creditor would hear of no Terms
except the Money down, and refus'd to take his
Security. M. <i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i> was so exasperated at
this Denial, that he wrote a Line to the First
President desiring him to set me at liberty,
which I obtain'd accordingly upon the Spot,
without Money, or so much as giving the Creditor
any manner of Security. M. <i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i>
too, in order to oblige me to all Intents and Purposes,<!--314.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
was so good as to get a Writ of Protection
for me, after which my Creditors could not
touch me: And indeed, considering the Situation
I was then in, that was the greatest piece
of Service that could be done for me.</p>

<p>I was no sooner got out of this Scrape but I
fell into another, not altogether so vexatious indeed,
yet very perplexing. In my Visits to the
President <i>de P&mdash;&mdash;</i>'s Lady, I became acquainted
at her House with a Widow, who tho' old,
ugly, covetous and silly, and to crown all, terribly
fond of Law, was so rich, that all those amiable
Qualities were over-look'd by a number
of pleasant Companions, who strove to make
Love to her, in hopes of contracting a Marriage
which seem'd so likely to make their Fortunes.
The Widow could not tell how to fix
her Choice; not that she was averse to Matrimony,
but the Conditions she requir'd were so
extraordinary, that the very mention of them
made her Gallants take their Leave of her. The
President <i>de P&mdash;&mdash;</i>'s Wife, who knew the Lady
very well, and my Circumstances even better,
advis'd me to try my Luck; and for my Encouragement
she promis'd to serve me: and serve
me she did so effectually, that the Lady was not
displeas'd with the Pains which she perceiv'd I
took to make my self acceptable to her. She
offer'd me an Apartment in her House; in short,
she made me to understand that I need not despair
of any thing. I had some Reluctance to accept
of that Offer, altho' it was so advantagious;
and for this Reason chiefly, the Want of Money,
because I did not care to be at her House without
being better equip'd. By good Luck my
Landlady, who was one of those intriguing
Dames with which <i>Paris</i> swarms, help'd me out<!--315.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
of this Difficulty. She discover'd all in an Instant
what was the matter, and in concert with
an <i>Italian</i> Valet de Chambre, who had liv'd
with me for some time, she help'd me without
any Difficulty to every thing that was necessary
for my Appearance with Splendor. I then hir'd
more Servants, bought very fine Liveries; in
short, all my Equipage was in a few days more
gay than ever. 'Tis true it was all upon Tick;
but our old Lady, as covetous as she was, would
not let me suffer upon that score. In the mean
time I had a very difficult Game to play; for I
was oblig'd to counterfeit being over head and
ears in Love with the most disagreeable Woman
upon the Face of the Earth; and at the
very time too when I was still courting Madame
<i>de R&mdash;&mdash;</i>, who without dispute was as handsome a
Woman as any whatsoever. Nor was this all; for
the old Lady, to be like the fine Women forsooth,
affected to be jealous; and whenever I ventur'd
to leave her, which was but very seldom, she was
sure to set on a Spy to watch me. We generally
went abroad together. By eight o'clock in the
Morning we us'd to be at the Palais importuning
the Judges, or else provoking the Attorneys
and Sollicitors to scold like Madmen. When
we had done there, the good Lady return'd
home and sat down to her Toilet, and I us'd to
sit by her in an Arm-chair till I was quite tir'd.
At first indeed I had some Pleasure in being so
near a Spectator of the Art by which a very disagreeable
Face may be sometimes made tolerable.
My old Lady's was all artificial from the
Forehead to the Chin; and I question whether
a Picture takes up more Colours than she made
use of to dawb her Features with? Her Apparel
was rich, but as much dy'd and daub'd as all the<!--316.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
rest. A Correspondence so tiresome as this was,
gave me a horrid Disgust; but yet when I reflected
what a Pass I had reduc'd my self to by
my Extravagance, I thought it was not my Interest
to break it off. I continu'd therefore to
play the Part of an amorous Suitor. And at
last, fearing that I should sink under the Fatigue,
I began to talk strenuously of Marriage;
but the good Lady still said it was yet too soon,
and that she was willing to have further Tryal
of me. She resolv'd at length to consent to it; but
'twas upon such extraordinary Terms, that really
I should have renounc'd any other Match upon
that score, if it had been twenty times more advantagious.
I resolv'd therefore to have no
more to say to the silly Woman, and to retire.
I thought of making another Tour to <i>Berlin</i> to
settle my Affairs, and to sell my Land if Mademoiselle
<i>de Pollnitz</i> would give her Consent;
but I put off my Departure for a little time in
hopes of seeing the Czar of <i>Muscovy</i>, who was
shortly expected at <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>This Monarch, from no other Motive but Curiosity,
came from one of the Extremities of <i>Europe</i>
to see the Court of <i>France</i>. They would
have had him make a public Entry; but he desir'd
to be receiv'd without Ceremony. <i>Verton</i>
the King's Chief Steward met him on the Frontier,
and conducted him to <i>Amiens</i>, where the
Marquis <i>de Nesle</i> complimented him in the
Name of the King, and then went with him
half way to <i>Paris</i>. The Marshal <i>de Tesse</i>, who was
charged to accompany the Prince all the time
he was to stay in <i>France</i>, went also to meet him.
The Czar arriv'd at the <i>Louvre</i> by ten o'clock
at Night, and was conducted to the Queen Mother's
Apartment, which had been sumptuously<!--317.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
furnish'd for his Reception. Some Moments
after his Arrival the Marshal <i>de Villeroy</i> came
from the King to make his Excuses that he was
not at the <i>Louvre</i> to receive him, by reason his
Majesty's tender Years and Constitution did not
permit him to sit up so late. They laid that the
Czar was not satisfy'd with this Excuse, nor with
the Regent for not coming to meet him. 'Tis
certain that he appeared to be very much out of
Temper all the Evening, would eat no Supper,
and took but one Glass of Beer: Nor would he
stay at the <i>Louvre</i>, saying, <i>That the Furniture
of his Apartment was too rich; and that his Attendants,
who were not the most cleanly, might
happen to spoil it</i>. 'Twas one o'clock in the Morning
when the Czar was pleas'd to shift his
Lodging, and the Marshal <i>de Tesse</i> would have
been sadly put to it, had he not caus'd the Palace
of <i>Lesdiguieres</i> to be furnish'd by way of
Precaution. The Czar thought this House also
too richly furnish'd, and notwithstanding all
they could say he would not lie in a magnificent
Bed which was put up in the Apartment that
was to be his, but caus'd a little Bed to be set
up for himself in the Wardrobe. Next day the
Regent came and paid him a Visit, when the
Prince <i>de Kourakin</i> the Czar's Ambassador to
<i>Holland</i> serv'd for their Interpreter. The Visit
lasted near an Hour, and there all the Ceremonial
was settled that was to be observ'd to
the <i>Russian</i> Monarch.</p>

<p>After this the King went to see him first, being
accompanied from the Palace of the <i>Thuilleries</i>,
with the chief Lords and Officers of the Crown.
The Czar receiv'd his Majesty as he alighted
from the Coach, and took him in his Arms with
a Transport of Fondness; at which the young<!--318.png--><span class="pagenum">312</span>
Monarch seem'd a little surpriz'd. He said to
the Czar, <i>That he was very glad to see him safe
arrived at <span class="f">Paris</span>; that he wish'd him Pleasure as
long as he staid in his Dominions; that he should
have the same Respect paid to him as to himself,
and that he had given Orders for the Court-Service
always to give way to his</i>. Then the two Monarchs
went hand in hand into a Chamber where
two Chairs of State were plac'd. The Czar being
the Stranger sate on the Right Hand. The
Duke <i>du Maine</i> and the Marshal <i>de Villeroy</i> stood
behind the King's Chair of State, and answer'd
the Questions which the Czar ask'd his Majesty.
After a short Visit the King rose first,
and was accompanied to his Coach by the Czar,
who at taking Leave of his Majesty caught him
up again in his Arms, and hoisting him higher than
his Head, said, <i>He wish'd that his Grandeur and
Power might surpass that of the late King</i> Lewis
XIV. He help'd the King into his Coach, and
did not return till it mov'd off.</p>

<p>Next day the Czar went to the <i>Thuilleries</i>
with the same Train as the King has when he
goes abroad, and rode in the King's Coach attended
by the chief Lords of his Court, who
sat over-against him, and at the Coach-Doors.
As soon as he enter'd the Court, the King went
to the Gate of the Castle, receiv'd him at his
landing, and then conducted him to his Apartment,
always giving the Czar the Right Hand.
I never saw more People at the <i>Thuilleries</i> than
there were on that day, insomuch that the two
Monarchs had scarce room to pass. The Czar
shew'd a prodigious Care of the King, kept him
up by one Hand, and wav'd the other to
keep off such as were apt to croud too near
him. After a Visit no longer than that which<!--319.png--><span class="pagenum">313</span>
the King made to the Prince, his Majesty reconducted
him to the Coach, and the Czar return'd
to his House with the same Train that
had accompanied him. When that Prince return'd
to his Apartment, he told the Marshal,
<i>That he was very much surpriz'd at the infinite
Croud of People in the way</i>. To which the
Marshal made Answer, <i>That the <span class="f">French</span> had so
great a Veneration for his Person, and so high an
Idea of his illustrious Qualities, that no wonder
they were so eager to see a Prince, who they knew
beforehand was deserving of their Admiration</i>.
The Czar seem'd very well pleas'd with this
Answer, yet he desir'd, <i>That for the future,
when he went abroad, the People might be oblig'd
to keep out of his way</i>. He paid a Visit
next day to the Regent and to <i>Madame</i>. The latter
talk'd to him for two Hours in <i>High-Dutch</i>,
and the Czar answer'd the Princess in
<i>Low-Dutch</i>. When he was withdrawn he said
to M. <i>de S&mdash;&mdash;</i>, <i>That <span class="f">Madame</span> was extremely
inquisitive; that she wanted to knew every thing;
and that she had ask'd him too many Questions; but
that after all, he told her no more than what he
was willing she should know</i>.</p>

<p>The Czar was very curious to see every thing
that was worth seeing in and about <i>Paris</i>. He
inform'd himself of every thing, and took care
to write every thing in his Pocket-book that he
thought remarkable. He rose at Day-break, and
rambled about from one Place to another till
Night. To prevent all manner of Incumbrance
he chose to make use of none but the Marshal <i>de
Tesse</i>'s Coaches, tho' that Nobleman would have
been well enough contented without such Preference,
because he kill'd several of his Horses;
and the poor Marshal himself must have sunk<!--320.png--><span class="pagenum">314</span>
under the Fatigue of the perpetual Motion that
he was oblig'd to, if the Czar had staid much
longer; but this Monarch lost no time, and examin'd
every thing with equal Nicety and Dispatch,
because he intended to be gone as soon
as he had satisfy'd his Curiosity.</p>

<p>The Court spar'd nothing to pay this Prince
all due Honors. The Regent for this purpose
order'd a general Review of all the King's Houshold
Troops, and of the <i>French</i> and <i>Swiss</i>
Guards in the Walks of <i>Roule</i> and in the <i>Elysian
Fields</i>. The Czar repair'd thither on horseback,
and 'twas expected he would have staid out the
whole Review; but he only rode briskly in the
Front of the first Line, without casting his Eyes
on the Troops, and then clapping Spurs to his
Horse, without paying any Compliment to the
Regent, he return'd full Gallop to <i>Paris</i>. From
thence he went directly to <i>St. Ouen</i>, where the
Duke <i>de Tresmes</i>, First Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber,
and Governor of <i>Paris</i>, gave him an
Entertainment, with which he seem'd better
pleas'd than with the Review. He was loth to
consent to the Admission of the Ladies into the
Orangery where the Table was spread, and only
spoke to Madame <i>de Bethune</i>, Daughter of the
Duke <i>de Tresmes</i>, for which Distinction she was
oblig'd to M. <i>de Bethune</i>, who having been a
good while in <i>Poland</i>, talk'd the <i>Polish</i> Language
very well, which procur'd him the Honor
of being able to converse with his Czarish
Majesty. The chief Noblemen, after the Example
of the Duke <i>de Tresmes</i>, made Entertainments
for the <i>Russian</i> Monarch. The Duke Regent
also prepar'd a Grand Feast for him at <i>St. Cloud</i>;
but just as the Czar was setting out from <i>Paris</i>,
he was seiz'd with a violent Fit of the Cholic,<!--321.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
which hinder'd his going abroad; nor do I
know that he had a Sight of the Castle of <i>St.
Cloud</i> at all. He seem'd to be more delighted with
<i>Versailles</i> than any other Place, insomuch that he
caus'd a Plan of it to be taken, and said, <i>He would
have a Building something like to it erected in his
own Country</i>. With this View he engag'd Workmen
of all sorts, and promis'd them great Advantages
to encourage them to go to <i>Muscovy</i>.
A great number suffer'd themselves to be taken
in, and the Regent consented to let them go
out of the Kingdom; but we are assur'd that
the Promises made to them were not perform'd,
and the Generality thought themselves very happy
when they were return'd to <i>France</i>. This
Prince was not liberal; and what Presents he
made were only valuable as they came from so
great a Prince. I saw a poor Soldier of the Invalids
make him a Present of a Plan of that
Hospital, which had cost him ten Years Labor;
but tho' the Prince seem'd to think it a fine
Piece, yet the Soldier had a very small Reward.
The King of <i>France</i>, however, made him a
noble Present, and thereby convinc'd him how
different the Temper of the <i>French</i> was from
that of the <i>Muscovites</i>. The Czar, in short, return'd
towards his Dominions very well satisfy'd
with <i>France</i>, and went first to <i>Holland</i>
where the <i>Czarina</i> staid for him; and from
thence he proceeded by Land to <i>Petersbourg</i>.</p>

<p>The Czar's Residence in <i>France</i> had brought
such a vast Number of Foreigners to <i>Paris</i>,
that the City being more populous than ever, new
Pleasures were thought of to divert them. A
private Gentleman made a Proposal to me,
which if I could have succeeded in, would have
been of very great Service to me at that Juncture;<!--322.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
for it was to put a considerable Sum of Money
in my Pocket, if I could obtain a Patent for licensing
Balls and Plays in the <i>Elysian Fields</i>,
where the Projector wou'd have erected Booths
for that purpose. I spoke of this to the Regent,
who, according to his Custom, promis'd me the
Grant at the first Word; but M. <i>d'Argenson</i>,
who was then only Lieutenant of the Police,
made him soon alter his Mind; for he represented
to his Royal Highness, that such Balls would
infallibly be attended with great Disorders. The
Objection was specious, and like enough to be
true; but after all, such a Licence would not
have increas'd the Disorder very much, especially
at a Place where 'twas for a long time the Fashion
to take the Air in the Night, so that there
were often more Coaches in the Course or Ring
after Midnight, than in the Day-time. Besides,
a way might be found to avoid all the Disorders
that could possibly be foreseen. But M. <i>d'Argenson</i>
was a Man that neither lov'd Novelties, nor Opportunities
of obliging. I was the better pleas'd
with this Project, because if it had taken, I saw
that I should be in a Condition to stay some time
longer at <i>Paris</i>, and to live in a genteel manner.
But at last, when I saw it defeated, I thought of
nothing but returning to <i>Berlin</i>. While I was
putting every thing in order for my Journey, I
saw the Count <i>de Rothenbourg</i> at <i>Paris</i>, who was
come from <i>Berlin</i>, and to return thither shortly
with a Commission on some Affairs of <i>France</i>.
This Gentleman, who encourag'd me in my Design
to go thither, assur'd me that it would be
the easiest matter in the World for me to sell
my Lands; that the King had just erected Fiefs;
and that he gave every Man leave to dispose of
his Estate; nay more, he offer'd to carry me along<!--323.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
with him, and to advance me what Money I wanted.
I thought all these to be very advantagious
Proposals; but they were Words without
Deeds. 'Tis true he lent me Money, that is to
say, Government-Bills; but taking an advantage
of the Necessity he found me in, oblig'd me to
conclude one of the most fatal Bargains I ever
made in my Life. I discounted my Bills, that is
to say, I lost considerably by them, and with
the residue of the Money I set out from <i>Paris</i> to
<i>Strasbourg</i>, where M. <i>de Rothenbourg</i> had appointed
to meet me: But for his part he went by
the way of <i>Burgundy</i>, where he had an Estate;
so that I staid for him near a Month, which
surely I should not have done if I had been in
Cash. When he came he told me, <i>That 'twas
impossible for him to carry me with him to <span class="f">Berlin</span>,
because he had no room in his Coach</i>. 'Tis true
that it was full, but there were some People in
it, whom it would have better become to have
got up behind. I was by this means under an
indispensable Necessity to stay at <i>Strasbourg</i>, till
I had a sufficient Remittance from <i>Berlin</i>, to
enable me to continue my Journey, without being
beholden to any body.</p>

<p>I did not repent my Stay at <span class="smcap">Strasbourg</span>;
for tho' I had been at it before, yet I never was
there long enough to make any Observation
upon the Remarkables of the Place. <i>Strasbourg</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
is one of the best Cities in <i>Europe</i>. 'Tis the
Capital of <i>Alsace</i>, and was conquer'd by <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. in 1682, without any Expence but of
Menaces and Money. That Monarch fortify'd
it considerably, and caus'd a Citadel and Arsenal
to be built there, which are Monuments worthy<!--324.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
of a Great King. The Cathedral Church has not
its equal for its Bulk and Grandeur. The Doors
are of Brass, and very well wrought. There's a
Pyramidal Spire 574 Foot high, which is a very
noble Piece of Work. The Great Clock is also
worth seeing. I was surpriz'd to see the great
number of Wheels and Machines that give Motion
to all the Constellations, and turn the
Needles, which upon Dials of several sorts
mark the Hours of the Day and Night, with the
Course of the Moon and the other Planets. In
the Vestry of this Church, which is very rich,
are most sumptuous Altar-Ornaments and Copes.
The Episcopal Palace which joins to the Church
is indeed a very commodious, but not a magnificent
Building, tho' it stands upon a considerable
Spot of Ground, whereon a fine Structure might
be erected; but there's no Appearance that such
a thing will be undertaken yet a while, because
the Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i> now Bishop of <i>Strasbourg</i>,
who would be the properest Person for it in the
whole World, resides but little at <i>Strasbourg</i>, and
justly prefers <i>Saverne</i> to it, where he has a most
stately Palace.</p>

<p><i>Strasbourg</i> was formerly an Imperial City, the
Magistrates whereof were <i>Lutherans</i>, but now
the Catholics are the Masters, and have excluded
the <i>Lutherans</i> from all manner of Employment.
The King of <i>France</i> keeps a strong Garison
in it, and the Commandant here for the King
is the Marshal <i>de Bourg</i>. This Nobleman lives
more retir'd than is usual for People that are in
Power. The Officers go to him very often in
the Morning, when the Marshal makes them
sit down in a Circle, where I have seen such a
Silence observ'd, that if Foreigners were Witnesses
of it, they would not twit the <i>French</i><!--325.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
with having too much <i>Clack</i>. This Levee
us'd to hold about half an Hour, after which
every one went to dinner where he pleas'd, the
Marshal only keeping a Table for Grand Festivals,
or when any Person of Distinction arriv'd
from the Court of <i>France</i>, which is very rare,
except when the Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i> is at <i>Strasbourg</i>.
When his Eminency is there, a great deal
of Company follows him, and he lives with an
Air of Grandeur suitable to his Birth and Dignity.
Add to this, that there is not any Nobleman,
perhaps, that is of a more courteous and
polite Deportment. When this Prelate is not at
<i>Strasbourg</i> the Place is very melancholy, especially
for such as don't run into the common Debaucheries
of Youth; for the latter indeed always
find wherewith to amuse themselves: and indeed
I have observ'd with my own Eyes that the
young Fellows of <i>Strasbourg</i> are very debauch'd,
and the Ladies very gentle.</p>

<p>After I had staid a while at <i>Strasbourg</i>, I receiv'd
News at last from <i>Berlin</i>, together with
Money to proceed in my Journey. I made
haste thro' the Cities of <i>Heidelberg</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, <i>Darmstad</i>
and <i>Francfort</i>, and stopt at <span class="smcap">Hanau</span>, where I
had the Honor of paying my Compliments to the
Count of that Name, who commonly resides
there. He married a Princess of <i>Brandenbourg-Anspach</i>,
Sister to the Princess of <i>Wales</i>, by
whom he has had but one Daughter, married
to the Hereditary Prince of <i>Hesse-Darmstad</i>, so
that the Family of <i>Hanau</i> is like to be extinct in
the Person of this Count. A part of his Territories,
<i>viz</i>. those which are Fiefs of the Empire,
will revert to the Landgrave of <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>,<!--326.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
according to Conventions which this
Prince has made with the King of <i>Poland</i>, who
was Heir to a good Part of the County of <i>Hanau</i>
as Elector of <i>Saxony</i>; but the latter sold all
his Pretensions to the Landgrave.</p>

<p>The City of <i>Hanau</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> stands near the <i>Maine</i>,
and is distinguish'd into the Old and New Towns.
The new Town owes its Foundation to the
<i>Walloon</i> Protestants, who came to settle in this
County during the Religious Wars in the <i>Netherlands</i>.
The Streets of this Quarter, which is
the finest of the two, are broad, and as strait as a
Line, and the Architecture of the Houses on
both sides is almost the same. A very exact Police
is observ'd in it, as well for the Neatness of
the Streets, as for the Security of the Inhabitants.
This Count's Predecessors establish'd several Manufactures
at <i>Hanau</i>; and here is a considerable
Trade in Snuff and Woollen Stuffs. The <i>French</i>
Refugees have contributed not a little to render
this City much more considerable than it was before.</p>

<p>The Castle or Palace of the Count is in the
Old Town; and he has another House at the
Gates of the Town call'd <i>Philip's-Ruhe</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, the Apartments
of which are very fine and nobly furnish'd,
and the Gardens are of a grand Taste,
and a very advantagious Situation.</p>

<p>From <i>Hanau</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Fulde</span>, an Abbat's
Town of the Empire, in which stands the famous
Abbey of <i>Fulde</i> of the Order of St. <i>Benedict</i>.
The Fryars are all Gentlemen by sixteen
Descents. The Abbat is elected by his Fryars,
and has the Title of <i>Primat of the Abbats,
Prince of the Empire, and Hereditary Chancellor</i><!--327.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
<i>of the Empress</i>. The Person who is now
vested with that Dignity is of the Family of
<i>Butler</i>. He maintains a great Court and several
Regiments; so that he lives absolutely like a
Temporal Prince. I should have lik'd his Reception
of me very well, if he had not made me
drink so hard, that if I had staid there longer, my
next Journey might probably have been a vast
way beyond <i>Berlin</i>. 'Tis my Opinion, Things
duly consider'd, that there's no need of any extraordinary
Vocation to be a Fryar at <i>Fulde</i>; for
those Gentlemen enjoy every thing that a Man
would wish for in a genteel Life. The House
they dwell in is more like the Palace of a great
King than a Convent; and the Abbey-Church,
and another lately built without the Town, may
be reckon'd among the noblest Buildings in <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Fulde</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Eisenach</span><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, thro' the
most detestable Roads that I ever travell'd.
<i>Eisenach</i> stands upon the River <i>Nese</i>, at the feet
of horrible Mountains. 'Tis the Seat of the
Duke of <i>Saxe-Eisenach</i> of the <i>Weimar</i>-Branch,
who being absent at that time, I had not the
Honor to see him.</p>

<p>I proceeded from <i>Eisenach</i> to <span class="smcap">Gotha</span><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, the
Residence of the Duke of <i>Saxe-Gotha</i>, who is
the most powerful Prince of <i>Saxony</i>, next to
the Elector. He is descended from the unfortunate
<i>John-Frederic</i> Elector of <i>Saxony</i>, who was
put under the Ban of the Empire, and depriv'd
of his Electorate by <i>Charles</i> V. The Town
is well built, and the Duke's Palace, which is separate
from it, is surrounded with Ramparts.<!--328.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>From <i>Gotha</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Erfurt</span><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, a City
which formerly was dependent on the Family of
<i>Saxony</i>, who by a solemn Treaty yielded it to
the Elector of <i>Mentz</i> in 1665; and it now belongs
to the present Elector of that Name. The
Inhabitants have made several Attempts to shake
off their Dependency upon that Elector, who on
his part has not been wanting in Measures to
make them easy; and has made considerable
Fortifications to the Castle, in which he maintains
a good Garison. The Town is large, and
contains fine Churches, of which the Cathedral
is remarkable for its Bulk: This Church had
formerly a most magnificent Steeple; but some
years ago the Spire was entirely consumed by
Lightning.</p>

<p>From <i>Erfurt</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Leipsic</span><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> one of
the most considerable Cities in the Electorate of
<i>Saxony</i>, and of special Note for its University
and its Fairs. The former, which was founded in
1408, by <i>Frederic</i> the <i>Warrior</i>, has always
supported it self with Reputation, notwithstanding
the Neighbourhood of the University of
<i>Hall</i>. The Situation of <i>Leipsic</i> is charming, and
which way soever one enters it, there are beautiful
Houses and Gardens kept in excellent Order.
The <i>Boses</i> and <i>Appel</i>, Merchants of <i>Leipsic</i>
have Gardens at the Gates of the Town, in
which they have laid out surprizing Sums of Money:
<i>Appel</i> especially has a Garden which a
Prince need not be asham'd of. Besides these
Gardens here are Walks, which are not the less
agreeable for being natural. Here is a remarkable
Wood, which is called in the Language of<!--329.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the Country <i>Rosendahl</i>, <i>i. e.</i> the <i>Vale of Roses</i>.
It consists of fourteen Walks, with a great
Meadow in the Middle. Each Walk has a
noble Point of View, and they are all agreeably
diversify'd. The Inside of <i>Leipsic</i> is perfectly
answerable to the Out-parts: The Streets are
very even, and the Houses large and well built.
The only fault I found with them is, that they
are too much charg'd with Sculpture, and not
duly proportion'd: They are all very lofty, and
for the Generality five or six Stories high. The
Rents of them are very dear, and at the time of
the Fairs there's such a Resort of Merchants hither
from all parts, that 'tis very difficult to get
a Lodging. When I came thither 'twas <i>Michaelmas</i>
Fair; at which time the King of <i>Poland</i>
was there. This Prince when he comes to <i>Leipsic</i>
does not lodge in the Castle, tho' it has
very commodious Apartments, but resides in
the House of <i>Appel</i>, the Merchant whom I just
now mention'd, who is Proprietor of one of
the finest Gardens thereabouts. That King
gives the Preference to his House, because 'tis
near the Place where the Fair is kept. So
much, <i>Madame</i>, for what is chiefly remarkable
at <i>Leipsic</i>.</p>

<p>I made no long stay there, because I was impatient
to return to <span class="smcap">Berlin</span>. At my first Arrival
there I liv'd very retir'd. I foresaw the
little Satisfaction I had to expect at that Court,
which made me resolve not to be seen there.
Nevertheless I could not conceal my self long;
for the Favors with which the Margravine-Dowager
had always honor'd me, obliged me to
pay my Respects to that Princess, who receiv'd
me very kindly, and soon after spoke of me to
his Majesty in so favorable a Manner, that he<!--330.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
was desirous to see me; and he sent M. <i>de Grumkau</i>
to bid me wait on him at <i>Charlottenbourg</i>, and
to send in my Name to him by <i>Ast</i>, one of his
Valets de Chambre. I could have been very
glad to have been excused from paying Obedience
to that Order; but it was too punctual,
his Majesty having actually appointed the Hour
that I was to appear before him. On the Day
fix'd I therefore went to <i>Charlottenbourg</i>, and
sent for <i>Ast</i>, who came and conducted me to
a Gallery, where he bade me wait a little time;
but I had not been there a Quarter of an Hour
when the King enter'd it, attended by <i>la Fourcade</i>,
Major-General and Commandant of <i>Berlin</i>.
His Majesty came up directly to me, and
ask'd me, with a good deal of Vivacity, <i>From
whence I came, and what was the Cause of my
Return to</i> Berlin? I made answer, <i>That I was
come last from</i> France, <i>and that my domestic Concerns
had brought me back to</i> Berlin. His Majesty,
who proceeded to enquire into my Affairs,
seem'd well enough pleas'd with the Answers
I had the Honor of making to him, and
turning towards <i>la Fourcade</i>, said to him, <i>That
he should never have known me, if he had not been
appriz'd who I was beforehand</i>: And then he
said to me, <i>That he should hereafter look on me
no other than as a</i> Frenchman. I made answer,
<i>That I should think my self very unfortunate if
his Majesty should look on me in that Light; and
that let me be at ever such a Distance from his
Person and his Dominions, I should always be
ambitious of calling my self his Subject; and that
I should constantly preserve the same Sentiments of
Respect and Loyalty to my King and Country, in
which I had been educated</i>. The King then
ask'd me, <i>Whether I had any Intention to sell</i><!--331.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
<i>my Estate?</i> I confess'd to him, <i>That I had no
other Remedy left to enable me to satisfy my Creditors</i>;
and I actually entreated him to interpose
his Authority to procure the Consent of Mademoiselle
<i>de Pollnitz</i> to the Sale of it. The
King said to me, <i>That he would give his Orders
to M. <span class="f">de C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, to engage her to hearken to
Reason</i>; and then he very graciously dismiss'd
me.</p>

<p>I went back to <i>Berlin</i>, and did not fail to return
Thanks to the Margravine for the good
Offices she had done me with the King. The
Queen returning some few days after this from
<i>Charlottenbourg</i> to <i>Berlin</i>, I had the Honor to
pay my Respects to her, and was kindly receiv'd.
It was quickly blaz'd after what Manner I had
been receiv'd by their Majesties, which was
Reason enough to engage the Courtiers to shew
me that Complaisance, which otherwise I durst
not have expected. I took little notice, however,
of those Gentlemens Compliments, but
prepar'd my self for finishing the Grand Affair
for which I was come. I caus'd advantagious
Offers to be made to Mademoiselle <i>de Pollnitz</i>,
to gain her Consent. The King order'd a Letter
to be wrote and sent to her at <i>Hanover</i>, to
determine her in my Favor; assuring her at the
same time, <i>That he thought my Proposals very
reasonable; and that her Acceptance of them would
do him a Pleasure</i>. I also went my self to <i>Hanover</i>,
to try if I could persuade her: But neither
the Visits I made to her upon the Affair,
nor those so powerful Recommendations of it,
had any Effect; and she continu'd obstinate in
her Refusal.</p>

<p>At my Return from <i>Hanover</i>, the King sent
me an Order to wait on him. I was introduc'd<!--332.png--><span class="pagenum">326</span>
by one of his Favorites into the Closet
where his Majesty us'd to smoak. The King
was then playing at a Game with Tables call'd
<i>Tick-tack</i>, the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> Velt-Marshal,
and several other Generals and Officers being
present. The King rose up as soon as the Game
was ended, came to me and talk'd with me
for a while very graciously. And then sitting
down, he order'd all that were in Company to
take their Seats. Every one took his Place
without observing any Rank. The King smoaked,
as did most of the Gentlemen in the Closet;
but by good Luck no body offer'd me a Pipe,
which I was very glad of, because I could never
smoak in all my Life. The King talk'd to
me a great deal about my Affairs; and in particular
about the Sale of my Estate. 'Twas not
long before I perceiv'd that my Cousin had
brought the King over to her Interest; for as
soon as my Land came to be the Topic of Conversation,
he told me in very plain Terms, <i>That
it would be very wrong for me to part with it,
even tho' my Cousin were to give her Consent to it;
that instead of paying my Debts with the Purchase-Money,
I would be apt to squander it in my Pleasures;
that 'twas high time to think of some Employment
to enable me to pay my Debts, without
selling my Estate</i>. He added, <i>That if, nevertheless,
I persisted in my Resolution to sell it, he would
write again to Mademoiselle</i> de Pollnitz <i>to perswade
her to consent to it; and that this was the
utmost that he could do for me, as Affairs stood;
since it would be an Injustice to compel her to give
a Consent to any thing that she imagin'd would be
to her prejudice</i>. After a little farther Discourse
with me about my domestic Affairs, his Majesty
talk'd to me of the Report current at <i>Berlin</i>,<!--333.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
<i>That I had chang'd my Religion</i>; and ask'd me,
<i>Whether 'twas really true, that I was turn'd</i> Papist.
I told him, <i>That I was of the Religion of
my Ancestors</i>. Here I will acknowledge to my
shame, that I had not Courage enough to make
public Declaration that I was a Catholic. Besides,
I hoped in so pressing a Dilemma to get
off by a double Entendre; which is a Rule adopted
by the Doctors themselves. The double
Entendre consisted in that, when I said I was
of the Religion of my Ancestors, I meant that
which was formerly profess'd by my Grandfather
and Great-Grandfather; and indeed all my Ancestors
were Catholics. My Grandfather himself
was a Catholic once, tho' he embrac'd the
new Religion, to swim with the Stream. The
King, who concluded from what I said, that I
was still a Protestant, did not press me farther
upon that Head;, but the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i> was
not so easily satisfy'd; for he gave the King to understand
that he believ'd the Reports of my having
chang'd my Religion, were but too true,
and he actually said to his Majesty <i>That the only
way to be sure of the Truth of what I had affirm'd,
would be to give me the Sacramental Test in the
Church of the</i> Dome. The King was also of that Opinion,
nevertheless it did not take effect. At
our leaving the King, the Prince of <i>Anhalt</i>, who,
'tis like, wanted to get a real Confession from
me, that I had chang'd my Religion, charg'd it
home upon my Conscience, and blam'd me very
much for not having own'd that I was a Catholic.
But as I could not be certain what was the
Drift of those Remonstrances, I was so far from
declaring my Mind to that Nobleman, that I
still continu'd in the Negative.<!--334.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>The Audience which I had of the King gain'd
me his Good-will; and he one day spoke so honorably
of me in presence of the Courtiers, that
my Friends advis'd me to strike in with this Ray
of Favor, and petition him for some Employment.
I followed their Advice, and wrote accordingly
to the King, who was then at <i>Potzdam</i>.</p>

<p>Two Days after I sent my Letter, I receiv'd
an Answer, sign'd with his Majesty's own Hand,
which was drawn up in these Terms;</p>

<p><i>I received your Letter of the 9th of</i> January,
(1718) <i>and for Answer I assure you, that I grant
you the first Pension of Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber
that shall happen to be vacant</i>.</p>

<div style="text-align: right; padding-right: 4em;">FREDERIC-WILLIAM.</div>

<p>I had such a grateful Sense of his Majesty's
kind Intentions towards me, that as soon as he
was return'd to <i>Berlin</i>, I did not fail to go and
thank him. His Majesty was so good as to say,
<i>That the Trifle he had now granted me was not
worth Thanks</i>. I thought, <i>Madame</i>, that this
was a very hopeful Beginning for a Man not
us'd to see his Undertakings crown'd with Success.
The Courtiers strove who should be most
complaisant to me; and I receiv'd Compliments
from all hands, which fully persuaded me, that
I was in high Favor: But my Stars did not indulge
me long with this Calm; and a Storm soon
arose, which drove me farther out of Port than
I was before. It was owing to the following
Accident.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Year 1718, the King
recall'd M. <i>de Kniphausen</i> his Envoy in <i>France</i>,
with a design to nominate another in his room.<!--335.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Several Persons sollicited for this Post; but I
thought my self as well qualify'd for it as the best;
and to pave the way for it, I propos'd to save
the Government a great deal of Charge, by contenting
myself with an Abatement of two hundred
Crowns <i>per</i> Month less than the usual Salary.
This Proposal was so well relish'd by M. <i>de
Grumkau</i> the Minister of State, that he protected
me, and undertook to recommend me to the
King. I also spoke of it my self to M. <i>d'Ilgen</i>,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose Daughter
was married to the said M. <i>de Kniphausen</i>. I
gave this Minister to understand, that I should
never have had a Thought of asking for this
Place, if I had not been satisfy'd, that M. <i>de
Kniphausen</i> himself had desired to be recalled. M.
<i>d'Ilgen</i> received me with the utmost Civility, and
promis'd with an Oath to serve me upon this
Occasion; adding, that he could not express his
Happiness in having such an Opportunity to discover
the Respect and Veneration which he had
for my Family. Such extraordinary Complaisance
in a Courtier made me suspect the Sincerity
of his Intentions, and I was quickly convinc'd
that my Jealousy was but too well founded.
When my Audience was over, this Minister
would needs wait on me to the Door: I oppos'd
it as much as I could, but when I saw it was to
no purpose I gave him his way, and he attended
me to the very Door of my Coach. I us'd
many words with him upon his own Threshold,
and begg'd him not to go a Step farther, especially
as it rain'd very hard, which you'll say
was Reason enough of it self to have engaged
him to retire: Yet it all signify'd nothing, he
would not abate an Ace of his Complaisance, but
stiffly stood it out by the side of my Coach, till<!--336.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
it mov'd off. This, however, was all the Service
he did me; for instead of serving me with the
King, I knew from good Hands, that he acted
the Reverse. I was told that he was not pleas'd
with me for desiring less Salary than his Son-in-law
had, who, when he was at <i>Paris</i>, was continually
writing to <i>Berlin</i>, that his Allowance
was not sufficient to maintain him.</p>

<p>To compleat my Happiness, the King receiv'd
an anonymous Letter, assuring him that I was
a true Catholic; and to inforce the Belief of it,
there was added to the Letter an authentic Certificate
from Father <i>Denis</i>, before whom I had
made the Confession of my Faith. The King
express'd his Resentment against me, and complain'd
that I had impos'd upon him. Several
People alarm'd me with more Danger than there
was in reality; however, I was not frighten'd
at first, for I suspected that the only Aim of the
general Talk was to hinder me from going to
Court, and did not think that the King was so angry
as they gave out, till at last I was appriz'd
that his Majesty had some Thoughts of putting
me under an Arrest. The Person who came to
bring me this Intelligence was <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i>, who was
very well with <i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i> the King's Favorite;
and I gave the more Credit to it, because I did
not think that he could be so dishonorable as to
attempt to do me an ill Office. This <i>H&mdash;&mdash;</i>
was a poor Wretch, who after having spent a
handsome Fortune, had a very small Pension,
which the King gave him, for having executed
a Commission at <i>Stralsund</i> with the King of
<i>Sweden</i>, which few but himself would have accepted.
As his Pension was too pitiful to subsist
him, several Persons reliev'd him; and I
will venture to say, That tho' I was not in very<!--337.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
easy Circumstances my self, yet I was some
Support to him. Nevertheless, I can with
Truth declare it, that he requited me with Ingratitude.
He came to me with an Aggravation
of that piece of Intelligence, which when
all was said and done, was not of such a Nature
as to drive me from the Court; but his manner
of divulging it, made me believe I was ruin'd
past Recovery, if I persisted in staying at <i>Berlin</i>.
He came one day into my Chamber with
a most dejected Air, and told me, <i>That he had
been just inform'd by M.</i> de M&mdash;&mdash;, <i>that as soon
as the King was return'd, I should infallibly be
arrested</i>; and at the same time he put on such
an external Appearance of Concern to see me
oblig'd to fly, that I took all he said for Gospel.
I resolv'd therefore to be gone; but the Difficulty
was to raise Money, which I had no means
of doing but by making a great many disadvantagious
Contracts, whereby I was a very great
Sufferer in the Sequel.</p>

<p>After I had made Money of every thing I set
out in the Night from <i>Berlin</i>, leaving word at
home that I was bound to <i>Hanover</i>; but as soon
as I was got out of Town I steer'd my Course
for <i>Leipsic</i>, where I staid a few days, and then
went to <span class="smcap">Mentz</span>, where I had a Cousin in the
Elector's Service, who entertain'd me as a good
Kinsman would do, and introduc'd me to his
Master, who gave me a most gracious Reception.
I have already had the Honor to tell you
of the Prerogatives of the Elector of <i>Mentz</i> at the
Coronation of an Emperor. It only remains for
me to speak to you of his Person. He was <i>Francis-Lotharius</i>
of <i>Schonborn</i>, of the Illustrious Family
of the Counts of <i>Schonborn</i>. Besides the Archbishopric
of <i>Mentz</i>, he had also the Bishopric of<!--338.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
<i>Bamberg</i>. He had then two Coadjutors, the Elector
of <i>Triers</i> Count <i>Palatine</i> of the <i>Rhine</i> for
<i>Mentz</i>; and the Count <i>de Schonborn</i>, Vice-Chancellor
of the Empire, for <i>Bamberg</i>. He might
then be about seventy Years of Age. He was
a Prince of a noble Aspect, affable, ador'd by
both his Domestics and his Subjects, and very
hearty for every thing that might contribute to
the Tranquillity and Honor of the Empire. The
City of <i>Mentz</i> is obliged to him for the noble
Works with which he has caus'd it to be fortify'd;
for it may be said he has spar'd no Cost
to put his Capital in such a State as to have nothing
to fear from Foreigners.</p>

<p><i>Mentz</i><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> stands upon a rising Ground along
the <i>Rhine</i>, in one of the finest Parts of <i>Germany</i>.
'Twas formerly no more than a Bishopric Suffragan
to <i>Triers</i>, but Pope <i>Zachary</i>, or as some say
<i>Gregory</i> III. erected it into an Archbishopric, and
granted him at the same time the Primacy of the
Churches of <i>Germany</i>. 'Tis said that the first
Bishop of <i>Mentz</i>, who was honor'd with the Dignity
of Elector, was nam'd <i>Willigise</i>, and that he
was the Son of a <i>Cartwright</i>, or, as others say, a
<i>Carman</i> of the Village of <i>Schoningen</i> in the
Country of <i>Brunswic</i>. He advanc'd himself
purely by his own Merit to the Dignity of Chancellor
to the Emperors <i>Otho</i> III. and <i>Henry</i> II.
and finally to that of Archbishop of <i>Mentz</i>. But
in all the height of his Fortune this Prelate continued
in such an humble Frame of Mind that he
caus'd Wheels to be painted every where about
his Palace, that he might have the Badges of the
Meanness of his Extraction always in his Eyes:
And we are assur'd this is the Reason why the<!--339.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Electors of <i>Mentz</i> always bear in their Arms a
Wheel Argent in a Field Gules.</p>

<p>The Chapter of <i>Mentz</i> consists of forty two
Canons, of whom the Dean and the twenty three
first are call'd <i>Capitulars</i>, and the other <i>Domicellaires</i>.
The former only are those that elect the
Archbishop, who from the Moment that he is
chose, becomes an Elector of the Empire. The
Pope confirms his Election in Spirituals, and the
Emperor does the same in Temporals. The Elector
becomes at the same time Great Chancellor
of the Empire of <i>Germany</i>, which gives him the
Title of perpetual Dean of the Electors, and an
Inspection into the Aulic Council and the Imperial
Chamber of <i>Wetzlar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mentz</i> has a very flourishing Trade, especially
in Wines. The best Vineyards for <i>Rhenish</i>
Wines are in the Dominions of the Elector, and
especially in the Neighbourhood of <i>Mentz</i>. And
that which also contributes very much to the
Briskness of its Commerce is, that all the Merchandize
that passes up and down the <i>Rhine</i>,
stops in its Harbor, to be put on board fresh
Bottoms.</p>

<p>I did not stay long at <i>Mentz</i>, but set out for
<span class="smcap">Stutgard</span><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, the Capital of the Duchy of
<i>Wirtemberg</i>. This City stands in a very fine
Country, and is divided into two parts by a
small River call'd the <i>Neckar</i>. The Houses at
<i>Stutgard</i> are generally ill built, yet as the Streets
are broad and lightsome, the Town is very gay.
The Ducal Palace is very old but very commodious,
by reason of the Extent and Number of
the Apartments. Here is a very fine Garden
with an Orangery, which is not to be parallel'd.<!--340.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
The Trees are kept in full Mould, secur'd by
a Roof and a sliding Partition, which they take
care to warm in the Winter by several Stoves
that make it one continu'd Summer. The Duke
of <i>Wirtemberg</i> is seldom in this Palace, except at
the time of the Carnival; but as for his Duchess,
she is there almost always, and has a separate
House from the Duke's, where she lives very
retir'd. I wish'd for an Opportunity to pay my
Respects to her, but was deprived of that Honor,
because I had not been introduc'd to the
Duke. This Prince's usual Residence is at <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>
a Pleasure-House which he caus'd to
be built some Leagues from <i>Stutgard</i>; but while
I was at <i>Wirtemberg</i> he was with the whole
Court at <i>Wildstadt</i>, whither I went to have the
Honor of paying my Duty to him. <i>Wildstadt</i>
is one of the vilest Places in <i>Germany</i>, yet 'tis
very much frequented by reason of its Baths of
Mineral Waters, which are said to be a sovereign
Remedy for many Diseases, especially Sciaticas,
and for bracing the Nerves. The Duke
commonly spends a Month or six Weeks here
with his whole Court, which being very numerous
and splendid, <i>Wildstadt</i> is then a Place agreeable
enough. The Duke had with him
the Hereditary Prince, his Son, who is married
to <i>Henrietta</i> of <i>Prussia</i>, the late Margrave <i>Philip</i>'s
Daughter. The Person of this Prince was
very amiable, and like the Duke his Father, his
Behavior is the most courteous that can be, especially
to Foreigners, to whom they are both very
kind. While the Court was at <i>Wildstadt</i>, their
Amusement in the Morning was the use of the
Baths, where the Duke and the Prince his Son
gave Gentlemen the Liberty of bathing with
them; for it must be observ'd that each Bath<!--341.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
will hold twenty Persons very commodiously.
When the Bathing was over, they took their
Rest. Towards Noon there was an Assembly
in the Apartment of the Duke, who went
from thence to the Apartment of the Hereditary
Princess, who lodg'd with the Prince her
Husband in a House over-against the Duke's.
There was a Table for sixteen Guests very well
serv'd, where the Gentlemen eat with the Duke
and his Children, and none but Pages waited.
After Dinner the Duke either rode, or caus'd
others to ride some manag'd Horses, than which
I have no where seen any that were more beautiful
or better train'd than his were. In the Evening
there was another Assembly at the Princess's,
where there was play till Supper-time. I
was told that when the Court was at <i>Ludwigsbourg</i>
there was a greater Variety of Diversions, and
that besides Gaming there was some Theatrical
Entertainments, of which the Duke was very
fond, and actually kept a Company of <i>French</i>
Comedians in Pay, who perform'd very well.
In a word, this Prince may be said to have neglected
nothing that he thought suitable to his
Dignity, or that might render his Court more
splendid. And that every thing might look with
a certain Air of Grandeur, he was resolv'd, like
other Sovereigns, to establish an Order, of which
he himself is the Head. They call it the Order
of St. <i>Hubert</i>. 'Tis a broad red Ribband, to
which hangs a Cross enamell'd white. None
are admitted into it, but Persons of distinguish'd
Families. Besides this Order, the Duke also
wears those of <i>Prussia</i> and <i>Denmark</i> alternatively.
The Hereditary Prince wears the <i>Prussian</i> Order
at large, and that of the Duke his Father at
his Button-Hole, just as they wear the Cross of<!--342.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
St. <i>Lewis</i> in <i>France</i>, except nevertheless on the
Festival Days of St. <i>Hubert</i>, when he wears the
red Ribband at full length.</p>

<p>Among the Persons of Distinction that accompanied
the Duke to <i>Wildstadt</i>, those of most
Note were the Count <i>de Gravenitz</i> and <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
which two Gentlemen had the sole Disposition of
Affairs. The first was Grand Marshal of the
Court and Prime Minister, and he wore the Order
of <i>Prussia</i>, the King having therewith honor'd
him at the Marriage of the Hereditary Prince
with the Princess of <i>Prussia</i>. This Minister, who
had the Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>'s intire Confidence,
had been nominated to accompany the Hereditary
Prince to <i>Berlin</i>. He certainly deserv'd
the Favor with which the Duke honor'd him;
and I have not known many Noblemen more
civil and obliging. But <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i> wanted a great
deal of being so affable; tho' his Origin was very
different. He was a meer Creature of Fortune, who
to be sure thought himself at the height of Felicity
when he was Secretary to the late M. <i>B&mdash;&mdash;</i>, Minister
of State to the late King at <i>Berlin</i>. Nevertheless,
after the Death of his Master his Star
guided him to the Court of <i>Wirtemberg</i>, where
he has amass'd immense Riches, and is entered
into the greatest Employments. He wears the
Order of <i>Dannebrog</i>, the King of <i>Prussia</i> having
desir'd it for him of the King of <i>Denmark</i>,
upon the Recommendation of the Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>,
who being very willing to give his Minister
some Badge of Honor, and not caring at
the same time to debase his own Order of St.
<i>Hubert</i>, caus'd the Order of <i>Dannebrog</i> to be
demanded for him, which is given to all Persons
indifferently without regard to Quality.<!--343.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>'s Court is altogether
<i>Lutheran</i>, as well as the rest of his Dominions.
Mean time he permitted the Princess,
who is a <i>Calvinist</i>, to have a particular Chapel
for her self and her Domestics. The Countess
<i>de Gravenitz</i>, Wife to the Grand Marshal, who
is a Catholic, was also allow'd a Chapel for the
Exercise of her Religion.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you what Title is assum'd by
the Dukes of <i>Wirtemberg</i>. They call themselves
<i>Banner-Bearers of the Empire</i>, which Title they
distinguish in the third Quartering of their Shield,
which is Azure with the Banner of the Empire,
Or charg'd with a Spread-Eagle Sable, plac'd
Bend-wise. The Dukes of <i>Wirtemberg</i> have
another Dignity more solid than the former, <i>viz.</i>
to be joint Directors of the Circle of <i>Swabia</i>, with
the Bishop of <i>Constance</i>.</p>

<p>The Duchy of <i>Wirtemberg</i> was formerly confiscated
to the use of <i>Ferdinand</i> I. Brother to the
Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. but 'twas afterwards restor'd
to the Princes of this Name, on condition of
their holding it dependent on the House of <i>Austria</i>.
This Feudal Subjection was annull'd in
1631, in the time of <i>Frederic</i> Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>,
on condition that upon the Failure of Issue
Male, the Duchy should devolve to the House
of <i>Austria</i>. In pursuance of these Treaties the
Princes of that Family bear the Title and Arms
of the Family of <i>Wirtemberg</i>.</p>

<p>While I staid at this Court that Disorder
which I had been teaz'd with for several Years
became at last so serious an Affair, that instead
of proceeding to <i>Vienna</i>, to which I at first purpos'd
to go, I set out for <i>Strasbourg</i>, in hopes
of finding skilful Surgeons there to make the necessary
Operation upon me. Several offer'd to<!--344.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
take me in hand, but the King's Lieutenant assur'd
me, that my best way wou'd be to employ
the Person that was Surgeon to the Great Hospital.
I did so, but can't say I had much reason
to like him. He may, for aught I know,
be an able Surgeon, but sure I am that he is a
very dangerous Physician. He thought fit to
give me Drugs (to prepare me, he said, to support
the Operation) which had like to have sent
me into the other World: But by good Luck I
perceiv'd his Ignorance before he had time to kill
me. I took no more of his Remedies; and
when I found my self well enough recover'd to
bear the Fatigues of a Journey, I resolv'd to go
to <i>Paris</i>, which I take to be the Nursery of the
most experienc'd Surgeons. I stop'd a few days
at <span class="smcap">Saverne</span>, where there was a very great Company
at the House of the Cardinal <i>de Rohan</i>,
to whom I had the Honor of paying my Compliments;
and he receiv'd me with that Air of
Politeness and Grandeur, for which we know this
Prince is distinguish'd.</p>

<p>From <i>Saverne</i> I went to <i>Luneville</i>, and in all
the Way found no considerable Place but
<span class="smcap">Phaltzbourg</span>, which was formerly a Part of
<i>Lorrain</i>, and had the Title of a Principality. 'Tis
now a Place very regularly fortify'd, and serves
to guard the Road into <i>Lorrain</i>, which <i>France</i>
secur'd to her self by the Treaty of <i>Ryswic</i>.</p>

<p>The Court of <i>Lorrain</i> commonly resides at
<span class="smcap">Luneville</span>, since the Beginning of the late
War, when the <i>French</i> put a Garison into <i>Nancy</i>,
of which they continu'd Masters till the Treaty
of <i>Baden</i>. This City, which heretofore was
inconsiderable, is now worth seeing. The Duke
of <i>Lorrain</i> has added a great many Buildings to
it, which are a great Ornament to it; and therefore<!--345.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
the Duke and Duchess chuse to reside here,
preferably to any other Place. As to the Duchess,
she has a particular Reason for being so fond
of <i>Luneville</i>, it being the City assign'd her for
her Jointure.</p>

<p>The Castle, which is very fine, has nothing
noble without, but the Inside is most magnificent.
The Entrance and Front very much resemble
those of <i>Versailles</i> towards <i>Paris</i>. As
to the Front towards the Garden I can say nothing
of it, because that side of the Palace was
not finish'd when I went thither. The Apartments
of their Royal Highnesses are spacious,
and richly furnish'd. The first Anti-chamber is a
very large Saloon of curious Structure. 'Tis
wainscotted and adorn'd with the Pictures of the
<i>Lorrain</i> Family. In one, the Duke's Father
is represented making a triumphant Entry in a
Chariot drawn by four white Horses, with Fame
flying before it, Peace and Victory offering him
Crowns of Laurel, and the additional Trophy of
<i>Turks</i> in Chains trampled under his Horses Feet.
The Whole together forms a magnificent Painting;
and I was told there are Tapestries in the
Duke's Wardrobe, which are a Copy of it, but
I did not see them.</p>

<p>This Saloon separates their Royal Highnesses
Apartments from the Chapel, which for the
Contrivance of it very much resembles that of
<i>Versailles</i>. It stands on the Right of the Entry
into the Saloon, and the Apartments are on the
Left. The Prince's Apartment looks over <i>Luneville</i>,
and over the Courts belonging to the
Kitchen, and the Princess's is situate on the Garden-side.
The Princess's is much larger than
the Duke's; and when I saw it, 'twas richly
furnish'd, adorn'd with noble Gilding, Glasses<!--346.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
and Paintings by the best Masters; but this Part
of the Palace has since been intirely consum'd by
Fire, tho' I am assur'd the Whole is re-built as
well as before, and that the Apartments are every
whit as well furnish'd. So much for the Palace:
I will now give you a short Account of their
Royal Highnesses, and their August Family, as
it stood in 1718, when I had the Honor to
see it.</p>

<p><i>Leopold</i> Duke of <i>Lorrain</i> and <i>Bar</i> was the
Head of the Family, and the Sovereign of the
Country. He married Mademoiselle of <i>France</i>,
<i>Elizabeth-Charlotte</i> of <i>Orleans</i>, Daughter of
<i>Philip</i> of <i>France</i>, Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, Brother of
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. By which Marriage they had three
Princes and three Princesses. The eldest Prince,
who was stil'd Duke of <i>Bar</i>, died in 1723, at a
Time when he was in Expectation of great Fortune.
His Brother, who is Heir to that Expectancy,
is actually bred up at <i>Vienna</i>, where
the Emperor takes particular Care of his Education.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Lorrain</i>'s Houshold is considerable,
and every thing is establish'd there on a
good Footing. His Hunting-Equipages are
magnificent, and so well furnish'd, that Foreigners
who accompany the Prince into the Field,
are equipp'd with Horses out of his Stables.
The Prince's Attendance is almost the same as
that of the Princes of <i>France</i>, and all his Houshold
on the same Footing. The Marquis <i>de
Craon</i> was then the Great Chamberlain and Prime
Minister. He was a very courteous Nobleman,
and treated all that had Business with him with
extraordinary Civility. He had great Credit at
Court, and the Prince was mighty bountiful to
him; insomuch that after having heap'd Wealth<!--347.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
upon this Favorite, he had a mind to see him
promoted to the eminent Dignity of Prince,
which upon the Duke's Desire the Emperor
conferr'd upon him accordingly. Not long after,
one of the Prince of <i>Craon</i>'s Daughters was married
to a Prince of the <i>Lorrain</i> Family, <i>viz.</i> the
Prince <i>de Lixin</i>, formerly known by the Name
of the Chevalier <i>de Lorrain</i>, who is now the
Duke of <i>Lorrain</i>'s Steward of the Houshold.
His Father-in-law has given him his fine House
at <i>Craon</i>, not far from <i>Luneville</i>. Madame <i>de
Craon</i>, who is a Partner in her Husband's Fortune
and Credit, is Lady of Honor to the Duchess,
and very much esteem'd by the Duke. I
had the Honor to see this Prince spend the Afternoons
at her House, and the Courtiers, after
the Example of their Master, did justice to the
Lady's Merit.</p>

<p>From <i>Luneville</i> I went to <span class="smcap">Nancy</span>, which is
the Capital City of <i>Lorrain</i>, and was formerly
the Residence of the Sovereigns of the Country.
It stands but a little distance from the River
<i>Meurte</i>, in the midst of a beautiful Plain; and
is divided into two Parts, <i>viz.</i> the Old and New
Towns. I had the Honor to tell you, that the
<i>French</i> made a Conquest of it in 1631. It had
good Reason to remember, that it was once under
a Foreign Dominion; for its Fortifications
were so demolish'd in 1668, that there was but
one Rampart remaining without a Parapet; and
in this Condition it was restor'd to its Sovereign
at the Peace of <i>Ryswic</i>. Not many years after,
when <i>Lewis</i> XIV. enter'd into the War for
maintaining his Grandson upon the <i>Spanish</i>
Throne, he oblig'd the Duke of <i>Lorrain</i> to receive
a Garison at <i>Nancy</i>. The Duke was so
disgusted at this Proceeding, that tho' the King<!--348.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
had given Orders to his Officers, to pay his
Royal Highness all the due Honors and Respect,
he would not stay in a Town, of which he
might be said to be Sovereign, but not the Master;
and retir'd to <i>Luneville</i>, where he continu'd
ever after, tho' <i>Nancy</i> was evacuated at the Treaty
of <i>Baden</i>.</p>

<p>A little way from <i>Nancy</i>, in the Road to
<i>Paris</i>, there's a Chapel and a Cross, said to
have been erected upon the very Spot where
<i>Charles</i> the last Duke of <i>Burgundy</i> was kill'd in
1476, when he was besieging the Town, then in
possession of <i>René</i> Duke of <i>Lorrain</i>. There's
a Copper-plate affix'd to the Cross upon the
High-way, on which may be read the Particulars.</p>

<p>Between <i>Nancy</i> and <i>Toul</i>, which is in the
<i>Paris</i> Road, one passes thro' the forest of <i>Haye</i>,
wherein <i>Lewis</i> XIV. caus'd a Way to be cut,
which will be a lasting Monument to Posterity,
of the Magnificence of that Great Prince. Those
who are bound to <i>Toul</i> cross the <i>Moselle</i> in a Ferry-boat
about a League on this side that Town,
to which they arrive over a pretty large Plain.
The Learned give a very ancient Original to
the City of <span class="smcap">Toul</span>; for they pretend it was first
founded by <i>Tullus Hostilius</i> King of the <i>Romans</i>:
But you may believe as much of this as you
please. All that I can say of the Town, after
having view'd it well, is, that 'tis very ill built,
and not worthy of the Attention of the Curious.
'Tis a Bishopric Suffragan of <i>Triers</i>, and one of
the three Bishoprics of <i>Lorrain</i> that were yielded
to <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Toul</i> I traveled to <span class="smcap">Bar-le-Duc</span>, the
Capital of the Duchy of <i>Bar</i>. This Duchy is
dependant on the Crown of <i>France</i>, tho' 'tis<!--349.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
part of the Dominions of <i>Lorrain</i>, and is under
the Jurisdiction of a Parliament. The Dukes of
<i>Lorrain</i> were formerly oblig'd, either in their
own Person, or by an Envoy, to perform Homage
to the King of <i>France</i>, upon the Death
either of a King, or of a Duke; which Obligation
was chang'd, or rather limited, during the
Regency of the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, in a Journey
which the Duke and Duchess of <i>Lorrain</i> made
to <i>Paris</i> in 1718, when it was regulated, <i>That a
Duke of <span class="f">Bar</span> should be oblig'd to pay Homage but
once in his Life to a King of <span class="f">France</span>; but that he
should pay it in Person</i>. This Convention was register'd
in the Parliament of <i>Paris</i>. But this was
not the only Advantage which the Duke reap'd
from his Journey; for the Regent, at the Request
of his Sister, restor'd a great number of
Villages to him that ought to have been restor'd
to the Duke of <i>Lorrain</i> at the Peace of <i>Ryswic</i>,
and which the Ministry of <i>France</i> had thought fit
to keep.</p>

<p>From <i>Bar-le-Duc</i> to <span class="smcap">Chalons</span>, 'tis a wild
desert Country, yet very fruitful in Corn. The
Roads are detestable if it rains ever so little;
which added to the length of the Post-Stages,
renders it a very disagreeable Journey. They
say 'twas in these Fields that the King <i>Meroveus,
Aëtius</i> General of the <i>Romans</i>, and <i>Theodoric</i> King
of the <i>Visigoths</i>, fought so bloody a Battle in 451,
with <i>Attila</i> King of the <i>Huns</i>, that they kill'd
two hundred thousand of his Men. But this is
a Fact which I will not warrant. The Situation
of <i>Chalons</i> is very advantageous. The River
<i>Marne</i> which runs into the <i>Seine</i> almost at
the Entrance of <i>Paris</i>, is a great Convenience for
the Merchants of that City. This City is in
<i>Champaigne</i>, and its Bishop has the Title of <i>Count</i><!--350.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
<i>and Peer of</i> France. The ancient Counts of
<i>Champaigne</i> resided here, and the Palace they
liv'd in is still to be seen. The Parliament of
<i>Paris</i> was transferr'd hither in 1592; and there
that illustrious Assembly pass'd that famous Arrêt
against the Pope's Legate, and the League, which
under the Pretence of Religion tended to deprive
<i>Henry</i> III's lawful Successor, <i>Henry</i> IV. of
the Crown of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>Several most illustrious Marriages have been
celebrated in the City of <i>Chalons</i>. 1. That of
<i>Philip</i> of <i>Orleans</i>, Brother to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. 2.
That of <i>Lewis</i> Dauphin of <i>France</i> Son of <i>Lewis</i>
XIV. with <i>Anne-Christina-Victoria</i> of <i>Bavaria</i>,
on the 7th of <i>March</i> 1680: And finally, the
Marriage of <i>Lewis</i> Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, Son of the
Duke Regent, to <i>Augusta-Maria-Johanna</i> of <i>Baden</i>,
on the 13th of <i>July</i> 1724.</p>

<p>There's not one considerable Place all the way
from <i>Chalons</i> to <i>Paris</i>. I pass'd thro' <span class="smcap">Chateau-Thierry</span>,
which is a Duchy that was given to
M. <i>de Bouillon</i> in Exchange for the Principality of
<i>Sedan</i>; with this Clause nevertheless, that the
King shall keep the Sovereignty of it. The
<i>Marne</i> runs at the Foot of this Town.</p>

<p>Ten Leagues from hence there's the City of
<span class="smcap">Meaux</span>, which is the Capital of <i>Brie</i>, with the
Title of a Bishopric. But neither in the Church
nor Town did I see any thing remarkable. The
Suburbs are very fruitful, and the Neighbourhood
of <i>Paris</i> gives the Inhabitants an Opportunity
of putting off their Commodities to Advantage.</p>

<p>'Tis but a few Hours Journey from <i>Meaux</i>
to <span class="smcap">Paris</span> in the direct Road. But I went some
Leagues out of the way to see M. <i>de N&mdash;&mdash;</i>, at
his Seat at <i>C&mdash;&mdash;</i>, near <i>Fontainbleau</i>, and after<!--351.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
having spent some days there very pleasantly, we
travell'd together to <i>Paris</i>. When we had pass'd
the Time that was necessary to discharge the Obligations
of Friendship and Decency, I reflected
on what was the real Motive of my Journey;
which, as I have had the Honor to tell you, was
to put my self into the Hands of some able Surgeon.
The Man to whose Care I committed
my self was the famous <i>La Peronie</i>, who perform'd
the Operation upon me with the utmost
Skill, yet I suffer'd extreme Pain. During my
Illness, which was of some Continuance, my
Friends, who were my faithful Companions,
were so good as to inform me of every thing
that pass'd; and if it had been lawful to have
betray'd them, or if I had been in any Post under
the Government, I might perhaps have
made some Discoveries to the Duke Regent,
which would have been to his advantage, and
enabled him to stifle that Flame at its first
breaking out, which indeed he extinguish'd afterwards,
tho' it was perhaps owing as much,
if not more, to his good Fortune, than to his
Prudence.</p>

<p><i>Paris</i> was at that time in a Crisis, when it
dreaded a Minority as troublesome as that of
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. Every body was dissatisfy'd. There
was a loud Clamor against the Royal Bank. And
the Government-Bills were a fresh Subject of
Complaint; for tho' they were establish'd at the
Beginning of the Regency, with a Promise to
keep up their Credit, yet there was a very great
Loss by discounting them; and as the Public was
overcharg'd with them, and as there is nothing
which sits so uneasy on People as their Loss,
every one gave public Vent to his ill Humor.
At this same Juncture the Duke Regent was<!--352.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
afflicted with sore Eyes, which indanger'd his
Sight. I was assur'd that the Chancellor said to
some People in Confidence, <i>That 'twas absolutely
necessary to think of proper Measures for transferring
the Regency to another Person, in case that
Prince should happen to be blind</i>: And they say
that 'twas for this Expression that he lost the
Seals, which were taken from him the 28th of
<i>January</i> 1718. When M. <i>de la Vrilliere</i> Secretary
of State went to him to demand them,
the Chancellor resign'd them immediately, saying,
<i>That he restor'd them to his Royal Highness
with more Pleasure than he took them</i>. At the
time that they were brought to the Regent the
Duke <i>de Noailles</i> was with him, who being
more than ordinary surpriz'd to see the Seals,
because he knew nothing of the Chancellor's Disgrace,
could not help asking the Regent, <i>What
he was going to do with the Seals?</i> To which that
Prince made Answer, <i>That he design'd them for
M. <span class="f">d'Argenson</span> Lieutenant of the Police</i>. The
Duke being dissatisfy'd with this Change, desir'd
the Regent's Leave to retire, which was
granted him with more Readiness than he desir'd.</p>

<p>The Seals were given upon the same day to
M. <i>d'Argenson</i>. The Regent himself sign'd the
Patent, and the Grant of the Great and Little
Commissions; and in the Afternoon the new Minister
took the usual Oath to the King; and at
the same time the Duke Regent declar'd him
Chief of the Council of the Finances. The Disgrace
of the Chancellor made the Parliament uneasy,
and occasion'd fresh Murmuring among the
People; the rather because 'twas reported, that
his Royal Highness ow'd him a Grudge for his<!--353.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Refusal to sign certain Edicts which were not
lik'd by the Parliament.</p>

<p>While <i>Paris</i> was in such a Ferment, there was
some Commotion in <i>Bretagne</i>. The Payment
of the Free Gift being demanded of the States
then assembled, they made answer, <i>That they
could not grant it till they had first examin'd their
Funds. They intended</i>, they said, <i>to regulate
their Finances, which were very much disorder'd</i>.
This Delay was look'd upon as an open Rebellion,
and at the fourth Assembly they receiv'd Orders
to separate. This put them quite out of
Temper, and the Nobility deputed four of their
Body to Court to present his Royal Highness a
long Memorial, in which they demonstrated
how impossible it was for their Province to pay
the Free Gift at that instant. They complain'd
of the Invasion of the Privileges of a Province
which had only submitted to <i>France</i> upon condition
that they should be sacredly preserv'd.
They concluded with praying his Royal Highness
to grant them, at least, some time longer.
<i>We flatter our selves, Sir</i>, said they, in the close
of their Memorial, <i>that a Delay of a few days,
contrary indeed to an ill Custom, but agreeable to
ancient Possession, will not give your Royal Highness
the worse Opinion of a Nobility which is so
much devoted to you, and to which you have declar'd
your Good-will</i>.</p>

<p>The Regent made answer to the Deputies,
<i>That they must obey and pay, and that then they would
see what could be done</i>. This Answer did not satisfy
the uneasy <i>Bretons</i>, and the Parliament of
the Province sent their Deputies to <i>Paris</i>. When
they were admitted to the King's Audience, M.
<i>de Blossac</i>, who was their Spokesman, made
much the same Representation as the Deputies of<!--354.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
the Nobility had done before. All the Answer
they had was a Declaration from the King, by the
Keeper of the Seals, who was present, <i>That
the Privileges of their Province should not be infring'd</i>.
The same Deputies presented a long
Petition to his Majesty, wherein they discover'd
not less Love and Respect to the King than Zeal
for their Privileges, but still insisted on the Impossibility
of paying the Free Gift so soon.
These Remonstrances, however, were as ineffectual
as those of the States; and the Regent, who
was resolv'd to be obey'd, made use of his Authority,
by banishing the most mutinous of the
Gentry from the Province, and others of 'em
he caus'd to be summon'd to <i>Paris</i>, as well as
several of their Members of Parliament, in order
to give an Account of their Conduct.</p>

<p>Such, <i>Madame</i>, was the State of Affairs when
I arriv'd at <i>Paris</i>. There was no Talk of any
thing but Disturbances, and every thing seem'd
to tend to a Revolt. The Duke Regent, in order
to obviate any Enterprize of that sort,
thought fit to secure the Soldiery in his Interest;
and for this end he caus'd them to be paid
punctually, gave Gratuities to the Officers, and
to put Feathers in their Caps he made a numerous
Promotion of the Knights of St. <i>Lewis</i>.
There was a Creation of about four hundred in
a few days, so that go where one would, there
was nothing to be seen but the Crosses of St.
<i>Lewis</i>. It were to be wish'd that the Species
had been as common, but of this there was less
Probability than ever. The Regent had just
undertaken a general Recoinage of the Money,
which seem'd to be a Thing of great Consequence
to private People. His Royal Highness caus'd
the Edict for this purpose to be register'd, and
foreseeing that the Parliament would not come<!--355.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
into his Measures, he caus'd the same to be publish'd
by the Officers of the Mint. The Parliament
was stung to the quick by the Publication
of this Edict, and pretended that, in order to its
being register'd, it ought to have been first communicated
to them. The Chambers met upon
this Occasion, and 'twas agreed that all the Sovereign
Courts mould be invited to join with
the Parliament in an Affair of such Importance.</p>

<p><i>M. L. C. P. P. D. L. C. D. A.</i> when the Invitation
was sent to his Company, took the advantage
of it to make his court to the Regent,
and went and inquir'd at the Royal Palace how
he had best act. The Regent took this well at
his hands, and his Royal Highness sent an immediate
Prohibition to the Court of Aids, the
Chamber of Accounts, and the Officers of the
Mint to take any notice of the Parliament's Invitation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Parliament still continu'd its
Assemblies, and sent a Deputation to the Royal
Palace, confiding of the First President, the
President <i>d'Aligre</i>, and several Counsellors, to engage
the Regent to revoke the aforesaid Edict;
and they represented in a very long Discourse,
<i>That the Rise of the Species could not but be prejudicial
to the</i> French <i>and profitable to Foreigners,
who would get sixty Livres by a Mark of Silver,
which intrinsically would not be worth twenty
five Livres; and that this would circulate an infinite
number of counterfeit Species in the Kingdom,
considering the immense Profit that Foreigners
would make by it</i>. They then complain'd of
the Edict's being register'd at the Court of the
Mint, and not in the Parliament, to whom it
ought, at least, to have been communicated.
The Duke Regent made answer to the Deputies,<!--356.png--><span class="pagenum">350</span>
<i>That he did not think he ought to send the last
Edict to the Parliament, because the Court of the
Mint was establish'd a superior and competent
Court in Matters of that kind; that there had
been no Edict sent to Parliament concerning the
Mints, since the Year 1659, except one which was
sent thither in 1715, out of pure Respect to that
Company; that as to the Inconveniencies, he had
maturely weighed them, but that he could not excuse
himself from issuing the Edict, and that as
to the Suspension of the Edict, 'twas not to be
thought of, the Work being so far advanc'd, and
a great Quantity of Species already given out, besides
Debts that must necessarily be paid off.</i></p>

<p>The Parliament not being satisfy'd with this
Answer, there was another Assembly, to the
Number of 165 Members, next day, <i>viz.</i> the
20th of <i>June</i>, from 8 o'clock in the Morning till
2 in the Afternoon, when they pass'd an Arrêt,
by which it was agreed to make most
humble Remonstrances to the King to obtain
Letters Patent for censuring the last Edict of
the Mint, not register'd in Parliament, as prejudicial
to the King, to Trade, to the Government,
and to the Fortunes of private People;
that in consequence thereof all Persons should be
prohibited to receive the new-coin'd Species, and
to make Payments in any other Species than
those which had their Currency, by virtue of
the Edict of 1715, and all Notarys should likewise
be prohibited to pass any Act for Payments
or Reimbursements made with the new Species.
This Arrêt was set up in Writing within the Palais
or Parliament-House, and the Parliament
took care to have several written Copies of it dispers'd,
because of the Prohibition which their<!--357.png--><span class="pagenum">351</span>
own Printer was laid under, not to commit it
to the Press.</p>

<p>The Regent, who was sensible how prejudicial
this Arrêt was to his Authority, assembled
the Council, when they pass'd an Arrêt declaring
that of the Parliament to be an Incroachment upon
the Regal Authority, and that his
Majesty revok'd and annull'd it, as well as all the
Resolutions taken in that Body. All Mankind
was alarm'd, and they fear'd, not without Reason,
what would be the Consequences of so violent
a Proceeding. The Parliament on their
part did not abate one jot of their State; and
when the King's Council laid upon the Table a
Letter de Cachet, with the Arrêt of the Council
of State, they agreed to send the Whole back
again without reading one Word of it; and that
the Arrêt pass'd the day before should be put in
execution according to its Form and Tenor.
Hereupon the Council of State pass'd another
Arrêt, by which the King claim'd to himself
and his Council the Cognizance of all the Differences
which might arise with regard to the
Coin. This done, the Regent sent two Companies
of <i>French</i> Guards to the Mint, and another
Detachment to the Bank: And after
having, by this means, made every thing secure,
he gave the Parliament leave to come and
make their Remonstrances to the King. The
Person who spoke in the Name of the rest was
M. <i>de Mesmes</i> the First President, at the Head of
seven Presidents <i>a Mortier</i>, thirty-two Counsellors,
and the King's Council. His Speech was
long and well study'd. He began with extolling
the Qualities observable in the young King.
Then he said, <i>That tho' the Parliament only
wish'd for the Opportunity of coming into his Presence</i><!--358.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
<i>to admire them, they were under a Necessity
of acquainting him with the just Alarms of all the
Orders of the Kingdom, upon account of an Edict
for a general Recoinage of the Species, which
impoverish'd those that had any Fortunes left in</i>
France, <i>without being any Relief to the numerous
Poor</i>. This Speech was divided into two Parts.
The first related to the manner in which the
said Edict had been publish'd. The second enter'd
into the particular Inconveniencies with
which the various Clauses of the Edict would be
attended, if his Majesty was not so far mov'd by
those Reasons, as to order its Repeal. M. <i>de
Mesmes</i> supported those two Articles by a Speech
as nervous as it was eloquent; and at the Close
he said, that in the Arrêts which had been pass'd
by his Company, they had only followed the
Precedents that had been found in the Registers.</p>

<p>The First President left his Speech in Writing,
that the King might be able to answer it;
and it was not long before the said Answer was
return'd. The Deputies of the Parliament being
sent for to the <i>Tuilleries</i>, on the 2d of <i>July</i>
1718, the Keeper of the Seals said to them in
his Majesty's Presence, <i>The King has caus'd the
Remonstrances of his Parliament to be examin'd
in Council, and his Majesty will always be dispos'd
to give them a favorable Hearing, when they
have not a Tendency to the splitting or the cramping
of his Authority.</i> He added, <i>That the Edict
in question had been maturely examin'd; and that
'twas the best Remedy for paying off the Debts of the
State; that the said Edict was not such a Burden
upon the Public; and that it was only so to those
who should make advantageous Contracts by obligatory
Deeds.</i> He concluded with saying, <i>That</i><!--359.png--><span class="pagenum">353</span>
<i>the King prohibited every Assembly tending to the
neglect of Submission</i>; and that he had given Orders
for registring the Letters Patent in pursuance of
the Arrêt of Council whereby his Majesty claims
the Cognizance of the Disputes already risen or
that may arise relating to the Edict. This Answer
being reported to the Parliament, Commissioners
were appointed to examine it; and at
the same time to search the Registers if there
was any Precedent for Letters Patent of that
sort, in order to conform to it. The Commissioners
having made their Report, the Company
came to a Resolution to represent to the Duke
Regent, <i>That nothing had been determin'd on that
Subject, because the Company desired that they
might first of all make new Remonstrances to the
King; and that they intreated his Royal Highness
to procure them an Audience</i>. The Regent
was nettled at the Parliament's Importunity, and
he made answer to the King's Council, who were
sent to him with the Message, <i>That he should
have thought that the Parliament would have rested satisfy'd
with the Answer which the King had
before given; but that since he saw they were not,
he would venture, notwithstanding the Dislike that
his Majesty expressed to Remonstrances, to give
them the Liberty of presenting them, but no otherwise
than in Writing</i>.</p>

<p>The Parliament was not discouraged, but still
continu'd to demand an Audience, which was at
length granted for the 26th of <i>July</i>; when all
the People of Distinction in <i>Paris</i> flock'd to
Court to hear the Remonstrances. The first President
spoke for nearly three quarters of an Hour, tho'
his Discourse was nothing more than a Recapitulation
of what he had said before. His Majesty
made answer, <i>My Keeper of the Seals will explain</i><!--360.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
<i>my Intentions to you</i>. But the Keeper of the
Seals said no more than this, <i>The King has already
explained his Intentions to you, and he will
explain them to you farther hereafter</i>.</p>

<p>The Parliament dissatisfy'd with this Answer,
which they thought too Laconic, as Affairs then
stood, fell in a Rage with the Man whom they
had good reason to look upon as the <i>Primum
Mobile</i> of the Confusion of Affairs; I mean <i>John
Law</i>, whose rapid Fortune furnish'd a large
Field of Discourse. They were very sensible
that a Director of the Bank could not easily acquire
so much Wealth, but a great many People
must be considerable Losers. The Parliament
therefore cited this Financier to appear before
them in Person, but he never went near them;
and when, in a few days after, they chang'd the
Summons to a Warrant for arresting him, the
Duke Regent protected him by an Arrêt of
Council. This Prince wisely judging of what
Importance it was to him to make the Parliament
easy, and to secure Respect to the Regal
Authority of which he was the Depositary, appointed
a Bed of Justice to be held at the Palace
of the <i>Thuilleries</i> for the 26th of <i>August</i>. He order'd
the King's Houshold Troops to keep to
their Arms, and to be every Man at his Post. The
same day he sent circular Letters of Invitation to
all the Dukes and Peers, to the Marshals of <i>France</i>,
to the Knights of the Orders, to the Governors
and Lieutenant-Generals of the Provinces, to
the Secretaries, and to some of the Counsellors
of State who were nominated by the Keeper of
the Seals. The Princes were also invited to this
Tribunal. The Parliament walk'd thither on
foot, about 11 o'clock in their red Robes. The
President <i>de Novion</i> was at the Head of their<!--361.png--><span class="pagenum">355</span>
Body, because the first President was at that time
very much afflicted with the Gout; however,
he went to the <i>Thuilleries</i> in a Coach.</p>

<p>After the Council of the Regency broke up, the
King went from his little Apartment upon the
Terrass to his Gallery, to which he was accompanied
by the Duke Regent and the Princes of
the Blood. Four Presidents <i>au Mortier</i> and six
Counsellors came thither to receive him, and
conducted him to his Bed of Justice. The King
being seated on his Throne, and all the Company
having taken their Places, they began with
reading the Letters Patent establishing M. <i>d'Argenson</i>
Keeper of the Seals, which were order'd
to be register'd. After this an Arrêt of Council
was read, forbidding the Parliament to take Cognizance
of the Affairs of State. Upon the
reading of this Arrêt, the first President broke
Silence and said, <i>The Subject seem'd to him of so
great Importance, that with the due Respect and
Submission which the Company had for his
Majesty's Orders, he desired his Majesty's Permission
to withdraw, to take it into Consideration</i>.
As little Attention was paid to this
Remonstrance, as to the preceding ones. The
Regent drew near to the King and whisper'd
him; and the Keeper of the Seals, after approaching
his Majesty for a Minute, made answer
to the Company, <i>The King will be obey'd,
and obey'd too upon the Spot</i>.</p>

<p>Then a Declaration was read, importing, that
the Dukes and Peers should have Seats in Parliament
immediately after the Princes of the
Blood. A second, which derogated from the
Declaration of the King, dated the 5th of <i>May</i>
1694, and restrain'd the Legitimated Princes to
the meer Honors and Prerogatives of their Peerages:
And a third, which re-established the Count<!--362.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
<i>de Tholouse</i> in all his Rights, Ranks and Prerogatives
for his own Person only.</p>

<p>After the reading of these Declarations the
Duke spoke and represented to his Majesty, <i>That
the late King having seem'd desirous that the
Duke of</i> Maine <i>should have the Care of his Majesty's
Education, tho' the Place belong'd to him by
Birth-right, he did not then oppose it, because he
was at that time a Minor; but as this was not
the Case now, he desir'd that the Honor might be
conferr'd upon him</i>: which Demand was granted
to him, as well as that of the Dukes and Peers,
who demanded to have Precedence of the Presidents
<i>au Mortier</i> in Parliament.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Bed of Justice, which will no
doubt be famous to the latest Posterity. The
Parliament was very much mortify'd at the Conduct
observ'd to them, and declared next day in
their Assembly, by an Arrêt which was register'd,
<i>That they neither could, nor ought, nor intended to
have any Share in what pass'd the Day preceding
in the Bed of Justice; and that Posterity
might be inform'd of it, Commissioners were nominated,
to draw up a verbal Account of all the
Proceedings</i>. The Regent being inform'd of
what the Parliament was doing, sent Detachments
of the Gray and Black Musketeers, commanded
by a Brigadier, who on the 28th at
Night, took up those that had been the most
zealous for this Opinion. Such were Messieurs
<i>de Blamont</i>, President of the 4th of the Inquests,
<i>Feydeau</i> Counsellor of the same Court, and <i>St.
Martin</i> a Counsellor of the Grand Chamber.
They were clapp'd into three Coaches, each
guarded by eight Musketeers and an Officer,
and carried to Places which the Court had appointed;<!--363.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
and at the same time the Papers of the
two former were seiz'd.</p>

<p>As soon as the Parliament was acquainted of
this Arrest, they met and made a Deputation to
the King, to intreat him to permit them to enjoy
the Privilege they always had of trying those
of their own Body for any Crimes they may be
accus'd of. The Keeper of the Seals made them
answer, <i>The Affairs which bring this Deputation
to the King are Affairs of State, which demand
Silence and Secrecy: The King is oblig'd to see due
Respect paid to his Authority. The future Behavior
of his Parliament will determine his Majesty's
Sentiments of, and Dispositions towards them.</i>
The Deputies went next day to the Royal Palace
to make fresh Intercession with the Regent for the
Liberty of their Brethren; but his Royal Highness
returned much the same Answer to them as
they had the day before, whereupon the Parliament
shut up their Tribunals, and left off decreeing
Justice. Mean time the King's Council
were always in Motion at the <i>Louvre</i>, and at the
Royal Palace, but could not obtain a satisfactory
Answer; and on the 5th of <i>September</i> the
Marquis <i>d'Essiat</i>, Master of the Horse to the
Duke Regent, gave the Company notice on the
part of his Royal Highness, to open the Courts
again, and to continue the Sessions, assuring them,
that an Answer should shortly be returned to
their late Instances.</p>

<p>Mean time the Rumor of the Violence us'd
to the President and the Counsellors that had
been apprehended, put a great many People out
of Temper: These Exiles were consider'd as
Martyrs to the public Liberty, and every Man
made their Case his own. Several Parliaments
seem'd inclinable to support that of <i>Paris</i>. The<!--364.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Parliament of <i>Bretagne</i> discover'd more Zeal
than any other, and wrote a fine Letter to the
Parliament of <i>Paris</i>, offering to join with them
in the Demand of the Exiles Liberty; they also
wrote another on the same Subject to his Majesty,
which they addressed to M. <i>de la Vrilliere</i> Secretary
of State.</p>

<p>At the same time a very important Event happened,
which took off the Attention of the
<i>French</i>, in a great measure, from their own Affairs,
and rais'd the Speculation of all <i>Europe</i>.
This was the <i>Spanish</i> Expedition to <i>Sicily</i>. To
let you fully into the Secret of this Affair, I
must go farther back, and give you a general
Account of the State of Affairs of <i>Europe</i> in the
preceding Year. The Emperor, in pursuance
of his Alliances with the Republic of <i>Venice</i>,
from whom the <i>Turks</i> had taken a Part of
the <i>Morea</i>, was sollicited to declare War against
those Infidels. The Pope, on his part, dreading
that the <i>Turks</i> should land in <i>Italy</i>, caus'd Instances
to be made to his Imperial Majesty to
persuade him to the War. The Emperor could
not determine with himself for a good while to
break with the <i>Turks</i>, for fear lest <i>Spain</i> should
take an Advantage of such Rupture, and fall upon
his Provinces in <i>Italy</i>. The Pope encourag'd
the Emperor, by acquainting him, <i>That the
King of <span class="f">Spain</span> had given him his solemn Promise
that he would undertake nothing in <span class="f">Italy</span>.</i> He
also gave him to understand, <i>That instead of having
any reason to be afraid of <span class="f">Spain</span>, he might expect
all manner of Assistance from that Crown in
the present War; since it had engag'd to send him
a powerful Squadron; and that the better to enable
him to do this, he (the Pope) had given him leave
to raise the Tenths upon the Clergy of <span class="f">Spain</span>.</i><!--365.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
These Representations made an Impression upon
the Emperor; but the Thing which absolutely
determin'd him, was the Treaty of Guaranty,
that he had concluded with <i>England</i>, by which
that Crown engaged to assist him with its Navy,
in case that his Dominions were invaded.
He therefore declared War against the <i>Turks</i>,
and sent a numerous Army against them, under
Command of Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i>.
The Campaign prov'd very glorious for this
Prince. He began it with a Victory near <i>Temeswaer</i>,
after which he laid Siege to that Place,
and in a very little time reduc'd it. Mean while
<i>Spain</i> prepar'd a Naval Armament, under Pretence
of sending Succours to the <i>Venetians</i>. But
how was all <i>Europe</i> surpriz'd, when it was
known that the Prime Minister of <i>Spain</i>, the
Cardinal <i>Alberoni</i>, heretofore Chaplain to the
Duke <i>de Vendôme</i>, afterwards Agent of <i>Parma</i>
at the Court of <i>Madrid</i>, and finally, by the
Queen's Favour, promoted to the Summit of
Grandeur and Prosperity, had prevail'd on the
King of <i>Spain</i> to employ the Sums that were levied
upon the Estates of the Clergy, and appropriated
for the Support of the Honor of the Christian
Name, in the Conquest of <i>Sardinia</i>! The
Reduction of it was attended with no great Difficulty,
because the Island, in reliance upon the
Faith of Treaties, was at that time but indifferently
furnish'd with Troops. The Emperor
made his Complaints to the Pope, and to <i>France</i>
and <i>England</i> as Guaranties of the Neutrality of
<i>Italy</i>. These Powers did their utmost to engage
the King of <i>Spain</i> to desist from his Pretensions.
The Duke Regent order'd the Duke
of <i>St. Aignan</i>, Ambassador of <i>France</i> at the
<i>Spanish</i> Court, to represent to the King all the<!--366.png--><span class="pagenum">360</span>
Inconveniencies into which this War might
plunge him; but the <i>Spanish</i> Minister, who rely'd
upon the secret Correspondence he had in
<i>France</i>, refused all Proposals of an Accommodation,
tho' they were so very advantageous to
the King of <i>Spain</i>: For it was propos'd to him,
that the Emperor should recognize him the lawful
Possessor of <i>Spain</i> and the <i>Indies</i>; and moreover,
that he should consent to the securing of the
Successions of <i>Parma</i> and <i>Placentia</i> to the Queen
of <i>Spain</i>'s Children; Terms infinitely more advantagious
than those that had been granted to him
by the Peace of <i>Utrecht</i>, and of which the King,
of <i>Spain</i> so earnestly desir'd to see the Confirmation
the Year that <i>Lewis</i> XIV. died.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
